Gemcitabine is considered as the first-line drug for PDAC and has a poor response rate of ~20% with a median survival of 6 months 34 , 35 . Even if gemcitabine was combined with other agents to improve efficacy for PDAC, the results are still very limited with a few weeks-months of increase in patient survival time generally 36 - 38 . Most failures in gemcitabine-based regimens in PDAC were attributed to drug resistance and subsequent relapse or metastasis 39 - 42 . In light of this, it would provide promising insights into clinical applications to develop therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer.\nIn the present study, we first reported that DTLL was able to improve the gemcitabine efficacy of pancreatic cancer and overcome its resistance as an ADC-like immunotherapeutic agent. Our laboratory had previously reported that DTLL exhibited potent effectiveness in a variety of cells and xenograft tumors including ovarian, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer 24 - 26 . However, the use of DTLL for combinational therapy has not been explored. Our results showed that the combination of gemcitabine plus DTLL had synergistic effects on both gemcitabine-resistant and gemcitabine-sensitive mouse models of PDAC (Figs.  2 ,  5 ,  6 ). Furthermore, we identified a critical role of SMAD4 in mediating the responses of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine chemotherapy. Based on differences in genetic status and protein expression of SMAD4 as well as drug susceptibilities between AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, we chose these two lines as models of SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant and SMAD4-sufficient/gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC, respectively. The results demonstrated that the combination treatment produced a significantly synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth, especially on SMAD4-defficient/gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells or xenografted tumors (Figs.  2 ,  5 ). To predict the enhanced effect of DTLL on gemcitabine sensitivity for clinical implementation in the future, two PA1233 and PA3142 PDX models based on their SMAD4 profiles were utilized to evaluate pharmacological efficacy (Fig.  6 ), confirming our observations from the CDX models. The in vitro and in vivo results from BxPC-3 stably transfected cells containing empty, mutant and wild-type SMAD4 overexpression vectors further demonstrated that SMAD4-deficient/sufficient cells showed distinct resistant/sensitive responses to gemcitabine (Fig.  7  and Supplementary Table  2 ), because of differences in wild-type and mutant SMAD4 protein expression. Another report also demonstrated that MIA-PaCa-2 tended to be the cell line with the highest intrinsic chemosensitivity, whereas PANC-1 and AsPC-1 were the cell lines with the most distinct intrinsic chemoresistance. Their results further confirmed our findings 43 .\nSMAD4 (also known as DPC4) was identified on the basis of frequent homozygous deletions and mutations 44 , serves as the central mediator of TGF-beta/SMADs signaling and functions as a tumor suppressor with over 50% of SMAD4 loss or inactivation in PDAC 45 , 46 , among which homozygous deletion and inactivation of SMAD4 were found in ~30% and 20% of pancreatic cancer patients, respectively. SMAD4 loss was directly associated with poor prognosis 47 , 48 , short survival rate 49 , metastasis 50 , and radioresistance 51  in pancreatic carcinoma patients. SMAD4 was associated with drug resistance to 5'-fluorouracil in colon cancers 52  or gemcitabine in hepatocellular carcinoma 53 . However, few studies have reported the correlation between SMAD4 and gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer. The impact of SMAD4 loss on chemoresistance has not been fully characterized. Consequently, few therapeutic agents have been developed to overcome chemoresistance.\nInterestingly, in the present study, we found that SMAD4 expression and bioactivity of AsPC-1/BxPC3-Mut and MIA PaCa-2/BxPC3-WT cells were distinct although DTLL or its combination treatment had inhibitory effects on both lines. In AsPC-1 cells deficient in SMAD4, we observed reactivation of SMAD4 with nuclear translocation to form a SMAD2/3/4 complex in the nucleus, and a decrease in SMAD7 expression (Fig.  3b-d ), similar to the findings in Fig.  8D . The SMAD complex in the nucleus then regulates the expression of different genes through interaction with DNA and DNA-binding proteins and acts as a tumor suppressor, eventually inhibiting tumor growth 54 , 55 . This result indicated that the combination treatment significantly inhibited PDAC tumor growth in a SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant model predominantly through a SMAD4-dependent signaling pathway.\nIn contrast, the combination treatment obviously inhibited SMAD4 activity in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 3b-d ), consistent with the results verified in BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8d ). Our findings demonstrated that the combination treatment enhanced antineoplastic activities via blockage of AKT/mTOR signaling pathways in gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC models. A previous study demonstrated that SMAD4 inhibited tumor metastasis in patients with colon cancer through multiple processes including the inhibition of apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway 56 . Their findings indicated an association between SMAD4 and the AKT pathway. In the present study, we also observed decreases in the expression of both SMAD4 and AKT/mTOR signaling (Fig.  3 a,  b ), suggesting that AKT/mTOR signaling blockade by DTLL or the combination treatment in SMAD4-sufficient PDAC cells might be attributed to not only blockade of EGFR/HER2 signaling, but also decreased SMAD4.\nAs shown in the schematic illustration model in Fig.  9 , we investigated different action mechanisms of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 on the PDAC drug response with/without DTLL induction (shown in Fig.  8 ). Our findings demonstrated that the  SMAD4  genetic status of PDAC is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels, which determine different cellular susceptibilities. Moreover, DTLL significantly altered the half-life time and protein levels of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 by inhibiting protein degradation at different velocities and changing the interaction of SMAD4 with TRIM33 (Fig.  8a-c ). In addition, DTLL predominantly enhanced the expression of apoptotic proteins (BAX, FADD) in BxPC3-Mut cells but promoted decreases mainly in antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) of the BxPC3-WT line (Fig.  8d-g ) through the regulation of upstream NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity. Moreover, NF-\u03baB expression was controlled as a target of either mutant or wild-type SMAD4, and the interaction of those two proteins in BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cell lines exhibited differently in an opposite direction (Fig.  8 h,  i ). The trends in protein expression affected by DTLL (including NF-kB, TRIM33 and apoptosis-relevant proteins) were mainly attributed to SMAD4 protein levels based on its genetic status. In addition,  SMAD4  genetic status significantly impacted the difference in proteomic profiles between BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8j ). RRM2 protein expression was obviously reduced along with decreased mutant SMAD4 in BxPC3-Mut cells, which is also partially responsible for gemcitabine resistance. DTLL alone or its combination treatment significantly triggered an increase in RRM2 expression, interpreting its mechanism of action on enhanced BxPC3-Mut cellular susceptibility mediated by increased SMAD4.\nConsequently, all the above findings suggested that DTLL is capable of sensitizing either gemcitabine-resistant or gemcitabine-sensitive cells to gemcitabine efficacy (or even other chemotherapeutic agents) through distinct action mechanisms according to different SMAD4 profiles. As shown in the schematic illustration model (Fig.  9 ), the mechanistic studies implied that DTLL combinational treatment might not only prevent neoplastic proliferation via blockage of ATK/mTOR signaling and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) mediated by impaired NF-\u03baB function if given to SMAD4-sufficient/gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC cells, but also restore the bioactivity of SMAD4 as a tumor suppressor to trigger its downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling of cell apoptosis in SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant tumors. The inhibitory effectiveness of DTLL alone or in combination with gemcitabine revealed that it functions as a double-edged sword in PDAC tumor growth, with totally different drug responsive behaviors and molecular action mechanisms on synergistic efficacy between gemcitabine-resistant and gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC. We speculate that DTLL seems to act as a module of the SMAD4 driver that normalizes its function as a tumor suppressor according to SMAD4 protein level and genetic status in PDAC, and then adjusts NF-\u03baB, TRIM33, gemcitabine-metabolic enzymes (such as RRM2) and proteomic profiles of PDAC cells, which explains the synergistic effect on tumor growth of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine. Further deeper mechanistic studies are necessary to verify our findings in the future. Fig. 9 Schematic illustration model of the DTLL action mechanism along with mutant and wild-type SMAD4 in PDAC cells. There were different action mechanisms of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 on the PDAC drug response with/without DTLL induction. The SMAD4 genetic status of PDAC is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels which determine different cellular susceptibilities. DTLL seems to act as a module of the SMAD4 driver that normalizes its function as a tumor suppressor according to SMAD4 level and genetic status in PDAC, and then adjusts NF-\u03baB, TRIM33, gemcitabine-metabolic enzymes (such as RRM2) and proteomic profiles of PDAC cells, which explains the synergistic effect on tumor growth of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine. Specifically, DTLL contributes to decreases mainly in AKT/mTOR signaling and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) by impaired NF-\u03baB function in WT-SMAD4/GEM-sensitive PDAC cells. However, DTLL predominantly enhances the expression of apoptotic BAX and FADD by restoring SMAD4 bioactivity to trigger downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling in Mut-SMAD4/GEM-resistant cells. Moreover, NF-\u03baB expression was regulated as a SMAD4 target in these two types of cells, and the interaction between these two proteins was different in an opposite direction. In addition, SMAD4 status significantly impacted the proteomic profiles, especially RRM2 expression. As a result, DTLL in combination with chemotherapeutic agents shows synergistic effects by either enhancing sensitivity or overcoming resistance in PDAC cells via wild-type or mutant SMAD4-mediation, respectively. Note: WT indicates wild type and Mut represents mutant (R100T mutation) SMAD4. (+), sufficient expression; (-), deficient expression.\nIn the current precision medicine treatment era, diverse genetic alterations in cancer subclones with unique hydrogenous signatures are responsible for the therapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancers as one of the biggest challenges. The most common mutations in PDAC occur in  KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A , and  SMAD4  driver genes 57 - 60 . In contrast to other oncogenes (such as mutated BRAF or EGFR), effective therapies that directly target those four driver genes are still unavailable in PDAC. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers or therapeutic approaches for the selection of adaptive PDAC patients. Given the critical effect of p53-related pathways on pancreatic cancers, reactivation of p53 has been investigated to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy in a number of preclinical studies 61 - 64 . A study on cell lines suggested that the mutant p53 activator, PRIMA-1, accelerated apoptosis and sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapy 65 . The combination of p53 transduction by Ad5CMV-p53 with two genotoxic drugs (gemcitabine and cisplatin), under a correct schedule of administration, appears to be a very promising therapy for human pancreatic cancer 66 . Researchers recently revealed a p53-dependent interaction between cancer cells and CAFs during the response to gemcitabine/abraxane, also suggesting that combining biomarkers of GOF (gain of function) mutant p53 with high HSPG2 stromal deposition may be used in the future to identify patients 67 . Undoubtedly, activation of tumor suppressors for the treatment of human cancer has been a long sought, yet elusive, strategy. A recent study also provided an example of a \"tumor suppressor reactivation\" approach. They found that the tumor suppressor PTEN was reactivated for cancer treatment through inhibition of the MYC-WWP1 pathway, and further identified a derivative of cruciferous vegetables (I3C) as a potent WWP1 inhibitor via PTEN reactivation, leading to suppression of tumorigenesis 68 . Our findings with a similar therapeutic approach for PDAC might provide important insight into clinical implementation via SMAD4 reactivation induced by DTLL combination treatment. Moreover, regardless of whether SMAD4 expression is sufficient, the synergistic effect of DTLL combination treatment on PDAC might enhance the therapeutic benefits of gemcitabine for patients. Furthermore, our findings may expand the translational avenue for cancer treatments. A previous study demonstrated a precision treatment strategy for EZH2-aberrant tumors that was based on tumor-intrinsic MLL1 expression and concurrent inhibition of epigenetic crosstalk and feedback MAPK activation 69 . For clinical application in the future, our approach might also require biomarkers to identify possible PDAC responders based on tumor-intrinsic SMAD4 status for rational combination regimens with either AKT or TGF-beta inhibitors.\nInevitably, there are several limitations in our study. First, we investigated the role of SMAD4 in mediating the cellular response in both SMAD4-deficient and SMAD4-sufficient PDAC. Mechanistically, we only studied the EGFR, AKT, NF-kB, and SMAD4-mediated signaling pathways, but more key drivers (such as PTEN, TP53, and KRAS) and their potential crosstalk need to be further investigated. Second, DTLL or the combination treatment increased the expression of PD-L1 in mutant SMAD4 tumors but reduced its expression in wild-type tumors, which might promote or inhibit immune escape in vitro and in vivo, respectively. However, whether the exact mechanisms of tumor immune escape and SMAD4-mediated activation or inhibition occur is unclear, which needs further investigation. Third, based on differences in SMAD4 expression and its genetic status, distinct molecular mechanisms were observed. More functional studies are needed to evaluate and characterize the effects of the combination treatment on autophagy, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in addition to the influences on cell proliferation, apoptosis and transcriptional activity. CRIPS/Cas9 depleted cells or transgenic mouse models would be more helpful in the future to further confirm and deeply interpret SMAD4 roles in PDAC chemoresistance. Furthermore, SMAD4 might regulate its downstream genes via a SMAD4-miRNA-downstream gene axis (such as AKT, E-cadherin, and Vimentin) 56 , further influencing PDAC. Fourth, due to financial limitations, we chose only three to four mice in the PDX models, as well as BxPC-3 stably transfected cell lines or CDX models for functional characterization instead of PDX models. More cell lines or PDX models need to be further selected. In addition, deeper investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms of SMAD4 in the functional regulation of NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling, TRIM33-mediated self-control of protein degradation and the RRM2-relevant pharmacokinetic pathway in PDAC progression and drug resistance. More specifically, further functional studies such as splicing regulation with both  trans-  and  cis -regulatory effects, need to be investigated. We demonstrated that SMAD4 status significantly impacted the proteomic profiles of BxPC3-Mut/gemcitabine-resistant and BxPC3-WT/gemcitabine-sensitive cells. The crosstalk between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in resistance to therapy. More studies need to be conducted to determine whether SMAD4-mediated chemo-sensitization is involved in the tumor microenvironment or immunodeficiency. Finally, clinical validation to identify the molecular profiles of SMAD4 and its relevant proteins and to predict the drug response of PDAC patients is essential in the future.\nTaken together, we demonstrated the synergism of gemcitabine and DTLL in both gemcitabine-sensitive and gemcitabine-resistant PDAC and identified the critical role of SMAD4 in mediating the cellular responses of pancreatic cancer to chemotherapy. SMAD4 genetic status is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels, and its R100T mutation contributes to loss of SMAD4 protein and function with rapid protein degradation, leading to resistance to gemcitabine of PDAC cells. DTLL altered the protein half-life time and level of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 by inhibiting protein degradation at different velocities and changing the interaction of SMAD4 with TRIM33 distinctly. Further studies implied that DTLL combinational treatment might not only prevent neoplastic proliferation via blockage of ATK/mTOR signaling and anti-apoptotic proteins mediated by impaired NF-\u03baB function in SMAD4-sufficient/gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC cells, but also restore the bioactivity of SMAD4 as a tumor suppressor to trigger its downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling of cell apoptosis and enhance the gemcitabine-related enzyme RRM2 in SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant tumors. Our findings may reveal a potential combination therapy for overcoming resistance of PDAC mediated by SMAD4, which paves the way toward a long-sought tumor suppressor reactivation approach and lays the foundation for future precision medicine as the first step.\n"], "ner": [[[229, 233, "DISEASE"], [391, 395, "DISEASE"], [560, 564, "DISEASE"], [766, 783, "DISEASE"], [883, 900, "DISEASE"], [[1102,

agents through targeted agents, gene therapy, and combinational treatments has important clinical significance. Gemcitabine is considered as the first-line drug for PDAC and has a poor response rate of ~20% with a median survival of 6 months 34 , 35 . Even if gemcitabine was combined with other agents to improve efficacy for PDAC, the results are still very limited with a few weeks-months of increase in patient survival time generally 36 - 38 . Most failures in gemcitabine-based regimens in PDAC were attributed to drug resistance and subsequent relapse or metastasis 39 - 42 . In light of this, it would provide promising insights into clinical applications to develop therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer.\nIn the present study, we first reported that DTLL was able to improve the gemcitabine efficacy of pancreatic cancer and overcome its resistance as an ADC-like immunotherapeutic agent. Our laboratory had previously reported that DTLL exhibited potent effectiveness in a variety of cells and xenograft tumors including ovarian, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer 24 - 26 . However, the use of DTLL for combinational therapy has not been explored. Our results showed that the combination of gemcitabine plus DTLL had synergistic effects on both gemcitabine-resistant and gemcitabine-sensitive mouse models of PDAC (Figs.  2 ,  5 ,  6 ). Furthermore, we identified a critical role of SMAD4 in mediating the responses of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine chemotherapy. Based on differences in genetic status and protein expression of SMAD4 as well as drug susceptibilities between AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, we chose these two lines as models of SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant and SMAD4-sufficient/gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC, respectively. The results demonstrated that the combination treatment produced a significantly synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth, especially on SMAD4-defficient/gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells or xenografted tumors (Figs.  2 ,  5 ). To predict the enhanced effect of DTLL on gemcitabine sensitivity for clinical implementation in the future, two PA1233 and PA3142 PDX models based on their SMAD4 profiles were utilized to evaluate pharmacological efficacy (Fig.  6 ), confirming our observations from the CDX models. The in vitro and in vivo results from BxPC-3 stably transfected cells containing empty, mutant and wild-type SMAD4 overexpression vectors further demonstrated that SMAD4-deficient/sufficient cells showed distinct resistant/sensitive responses to gemcitabine (Fig.  7  and Supplementary Table  2 ), because of differences in wild-type and mutant SMAD4 protein expression. Another report also demonstrated that MIA-PaCa-2 tended to be the cell line with the highest intrinsic chemosensitivity, whereas PANC-1 and AsPC-1 were the cell lines with the most distinct intrinsic chemoresistance. Their results further confirmed our findings 43 .\nSMAD4 (also known as DPC4) was identified on the basis of frequent homozygous deletions and mutations 44 , serves as the central mediator of TGF-beta/SMADs signaling and functions as a tumor suppressor with over 50% of SMAD4 loss or inactivation in PDAC 45 , 46 , among which homozygous deletion and inactivation of SMAD4 were found in ~30% and 20% of pancreatic cancer patients, respectively. SMAD4 loss was directly associated with poor prognosis 47 , 48 , short survival rate 49 , metastasis 50 , and radioresistance 51  in pancreatic carcinoma patients. SMAD4 was associated with drug resistance to 5'-fluorouracil in colon cancers 52  or gemcitabine in hepatocellular carcinoma 53 . However, few studies have reported the correlation between SMAD4 and gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer. The impact of SMAD4 loss on chemoresistance has not been fully characterized. Consequently, few therapeutic agents have been developed to overcome chemoresistance.", "\nInterestingly, in the present study, we found that SMAD4 expression and bioactivity of AsPC-1/BxPC3-Mut and MIA PaCa-2/BxPC3-WT cells were distinct although DTLL or its combination treatment had inhibitory effects on both lines. In AsPC-1 cells deficient in SMAD4, we observed reactivation of SMAD4 with nuclear translocation to form a SMAD2/3/4 complex in the nucleus, and a decrease in SMAD7 expression (Fig.  3b-d ), similar to the findings in Fig.  8D . The SMAD complex in the nucleus then regulates the expression of different genes through interaction with DNA and DNA-binding proteins and acts as a tumor suppressor, eventually inhibiting tumor growth 54 , 55 . This result indicated that the combination treatment significantly inhibited PDAC tumor growth in a SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant model predominantly through a SMAD4-dependent signaling pathway.\nIn contrast, the combination treatment obviously inhibited SMAD4 activity in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 3b-d ), consistent with the results verified in BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8d ). Our findings demonstrated that the combination treatment enhanced antineoplastic activities via blockage of AKT/mTOR signaling pathways in gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC models. A previous study demonstrated that SMAD4 inhibited tumor metastasis in patients with colon cancer through multiple processes including the inhibition of apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway 56 . Their findings indicated an association between SMAD4 and the AKT pathway. In the present study, we also observed decreases in the expression of both SMAD4 and AKT/mTOR signaling (Fig.  3 a,  b ), suggesting that AKT/mTOR signaling blockade by DTLL or the combination treatment in SMAD4-sufficient PDAC cells might be attributed to not only blockade of EGFR/HER2 signaling, but also decreased SMAD4.\nAs shown in the schematic illustration model in Fig.  9 , we investigated different action mechanisms of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 on the PDAC drug response with/without DTLL induction (shown in Fig.  8 ). Our findings demonstrated that the  SMAD4  genetic status of PDAC is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels, which determine different cellular susceptibilities. Moreover, DTLL significantly altered the half-life time and protein levels of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 by inhibiting protein degradation at different velocities and changing the interaction of SMAD4 with TRIM33 (Fig.  8a-c ). In addition, DTLL predominantly enhanced the expression of apoptotic proteins (BAX, FADD) in BxPC3-Mut cells but promoted decreases mainly in antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) of the BxPC3-WT line (Fig.  8d-g ) through the regulation of upstream NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity. Moreover, NF-\u03baB expression was controlled as a target of either mutant or wild-type SMAD4, and the interaction of those two proteins in BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cell lines exhibited differently in an opposite direction (Fig.  8 h,  i ). The trends in protein expression affected by DTLL (including NF-kB, TRIM33 and apoptosis-relevant proteins) were mainly attributed to SMAD4 protein levels based on its genetic status. In addition,  SMAD4  genetic status significantly impacted the difference in proteomic profiles between BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8j ). RRM2 protein expression was obviously reduced along with decreased mutant SMAD4 in BxPC3-Mut cells, which is also partially responsible for gemcitabine resistance. DTLL alone or its combination treatment significantly triggered an increase in RRM2 expression, interpreting its mechanism of action on enhanced BxPC3-Mut cellular susceptibility mediated by increased SMAD4.\nConsequently, all the above findings suggested that DTLL is capable of sensitizing either gemcitabine-resistant or gemcitabine-sensitive cells to gemcitabine efficacy (or even other chemotherapeutic agents) through distinct action mechanisms according to different SMAD4 profiles.", " As shown in the schematic illustration model (Fig.  9 ), the mechanistic studies implied that DTLL combinational treatment might not only prevent neoplastic proliferation via blockage of ATK/mTOR signaling and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) mediated by impaired NF-\u03baB function if given to SMAD4-sufficient/gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC cells, but also restore the bioactivity of SMAD4 as a tumor suppressor to trigger its downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling of cell apoptosis in SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant tumors. The inhibitory effectiveness of DTLL alone or in combination with gemcitabine revealed that it functions as a double-edged sword in PDAC tumor growth, with totally different drug responsive behaviors and molecular action mechanisms on synergistic efficacy between gemcitabine-resistant and gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC. We speculate that DTLL seems to act as a module of the SMAD4 driver that normalizes its function as a tumor suppressor according to SMAD4 protein level and genetic status in PDAC, and then adjusts NF-\u03baB, TRIM33, gemcitabine-metabolic enzymes (such as RRM2) and proteomic profiles of PDAC cells, which explains the synergistic effect on tumor growth of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine. Further deeper mechanistic studies are necessary to verify our findings in the future. Fig. 9 Schematic illustration model of the DTLL action mechanism along with mutant and wild-type SMAD4 in PDAC cells. There were different action mechanisms of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 on the PDAC drug response with/without DTLL induction. The SMAD4 genetic status of PDAC is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels which determine different cellular susceptibilities. DTLL seems to act as a module of the SMAD4 driver that normalizes its function as a tumor suppressor according to SMAD4 level and genetic status in PDAC, and then adjusts NF-\u03baB, TRIM33, gemcitabine-metabolic enzymes (such as RRM2) and proteomic profiles of PDAC cells, which explains the synergistic effect on tumor growth of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine. Specifically, DTLL contributes to decreases mainly in AKT/mTOR signaling and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) by impaired NF-\u03baB function in WT-SMAD4/GEM-sensitive PDAC cells. However, DTLL predominantly enhances the expression of apoptotic BAX and FADD by restoring SMAD4 bioactivity to trigger downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling in Mut-SMAD4/GEM-resistant cells. Moreover, NF-\u03baB expression was regulated as a SMAD4 target in these two types of cells, and the interaction between these two proteins was different in an opposite direction. In addition, SMAD4 status significantly impacted the proteomic profiles, especially RRM2 expression. As a result, DTLL in combination with chemotherapeutic agents shows synergistic effects by either enhancing sensitivity or overcoming resistance in PDAC cells via wild-type or mutant SMAD4-mediation, respectively. Note: WT indicates wild type and Mut represents mutant (R100T mutation) SMAD4. (+), sufficient expression; (-), deficient expression.\nIn the current precision medicine treatment era, diverse genetic alterations in cancer subclones with unique hydrogenous signatures are responsible for the therapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancers as one of the biggest challenges. The most common mutations in PDAC occur in  KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A , and  SMAD4  driver genes 57 - 60 . In contrast to other oncogenes (such as mutated BRAF or EGFR), effective therapies that directly target those four driver genes are still unavailable in PDAC. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers or therapeutic approaches for the selection of adaptive PDAC patients. Given the critical effect of p53-related pathways on pancreatic cancers, reactivation of p53 has been investigated to sensitize tumors to chemotherapy in a number of preclinical studies 61 - 64 . A study on cell lines suggested that the mutant p53 activator, PRIMA-1, accelerated apoptosis and sensitized tumor cells", " to chemotherapy 65 . The combination of p53 transduction by Ad5CMV-p53 with two genotoxic drugs (gemcitabine and cisplatin), under a correct schedule of administration, appears to be a very promising therapy for human pancreatic cancer 66 . Researchers recently revealed a p53-dependent interaction between cancer cells and CAFs during the response to gemcitabine/abraxane, also suggesting that combining biomarkers of GOF (gain of function) mutant p53 with high HSPG2 stromal deposition may be used in the future to identify patients 67 . Undoubtedly, activation of tumor suppressors for the treatment of human cancer has been a long sought, yet elusive, strategy. A recent study also provided an example of a \"tumor suppressor reactivation\" approach. They found that the tumor suppressor PTEN was reactivated for cancer treatment through inhibition of the MYC-WWP1 pathway, and further identified a derivative of cruciferous vegetables (I3C) as a potent WWP1 inhibitor via PTEN reactivation, leading to suppression of tumorigenesis 68 . Our findings with a similar therapeutic approach for PDAC might provide important insight into clinical implementation via SMAD4 reactivation induced by DTLL combination treatment. Moreover, regardless of whether SMAD4 expression is sufficient, the synergistic effect of DTLL combination treatment on PDAC might enhance the therapeutic benefits of gemcitabine for patients. Furthermore, our findings may expand the translational avenue for cancer treatments. A previous study demonstrated a precision treatment strategy for EZH2-aberrant tumors that was based on tumor-intrinsic MLL1 expression and concurrent inhibition of epigenetic crosstalk and feedback MAPK activation 69 . For clinical application in the future, our approach might also require biomarkers to identify possible PDAC responders based on tumor-intrinsic SMAD4 status for rational combination regimens with either AKT or TGF-beta inhibitors.\nInevitably, there are several limitations in our study. First, we investigated the role of SMAD4 in mediating the cellular response in both SMAD4-deficient and SMAD4-sufficient PDAC. Mechanistically, we only studied the EGFR, AKT, NF-kB, and SMAD4-mediated signaling pathways, but more key drivers (such as PTEN, TP53, and KRAS) and their potential crosstalk need to be further investigated. Second, DTLL or the combination treatment increased the expression of PD-L1 in mutant SMAD4 tumors but reduced its expression in wild-type tumors, which might promote or inhibit immune escape in vitro and in vivo, respectively. However, whether the exact mechanisms of tumor immune escape and SMAD4-mediated activation or inhibition occur is unclear, which needs further investigation. Third, based on differences in SMAD4 expression and its genetic status, distinct molecular mechanisms were observed. More functional studies are needed to evaluate and characterize the effects of the combination treatment on autophagy, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in addition to the influences on cell proliferation, apoptosis and transcriptional activity. CRIPS/Cas9 depleted cells or transgenic mouse models would be more helpful in the future to further confirm and deeply interpret SMAD4 roles in PDAC chemoresistance. Furthermore, SMAD4 might regulate its downstream genes via a SMAD4-miRNA-downstream gene axis (such as AKT, E-cadherin, and Vimentin) 56 , further influencing PDAC. Fourth, due to financial limitations, we chose only three to four mice in the PDX models, as well as BxPC-3 stably transfected cell lines or CDX models for functional characterization instead of PDX models. More cell lines or PDX models need to be further selected. In addition, deeper investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms of SMAD4 in the functional regulation of NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling, TRIM33-mediated self-control of protein degradation and the RRM2-relevant pharmacokinetic pathway in PDAC progression and drug r", "esistance. More specifically, further functional studies such as splicing regulation with both  trans-  and  cis -regulatory effects, need to be investigated. We demonstrated that SMAD4 status significantly impacted the proteomic profiles of BxPC3-Mut/gemcitabine-resistant and BxPC3-WT/gemcitabine-sensitive cells. The crosstalk between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in resistance to therapy. More studies need to be conducted to determine whether SMAD4-mediated chemo-sensitization is involved in the tumor microenvironment or immunodeficiency. Finally, clinical validation to identify the molecular profiles of SMAD4 and its relevant proteins and to predict the drug response of PDAC patients is essential in the future.\nTaken together, we demonstrated the synergism of gemcitabine and DTLL in both gemcitabine-sensitive and gemcitabine-resistant PDAC and identified the critical role of SMAD4 in mediating the cellular responses of pancreatic cancer to chemotherapy. SMAD4 genetic status is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels, and its R100T mutation contributes to loss of SMAD4 protein and function with rapid protein degradation, leading to resistance to gemcitabine of PDAC cells. DTLL altered the protein half-life time and level of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 by inhibiting protein degradation at different velocities and changing the interaction of SMAD4 with TRIM33 distinctly. Further studies implied that DTLL combinational treatment might not only prevent neoplastic proliferation via blockage of ATK/mTOR signaling and anti-apoptotic proteins mediated by impaired NF-\u03baB function in SMAD4-sufficient/gemcitabine-sensitive PDAC cells, but also restore the bioactivity of SMAD4 as a tumor suppressor to trigger its downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling of cell apoptosis and enhance the gemcitabine-related enzyme RRM2 in SMAD4-deficient/gemcitabine-resistant tumors. Our findings may reveal a potential combination therapy for overcoming resistance of PDAC mediated by SMAD4, which paves the way toward a long-sought tumor suppressor reactivation approach and lays the foundation for future precision medicine as the first step.\n"]}

For siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with a pooled sample of four SMAD4-specific siRNA oligos at a final concentration of 10 nmol/L using Lipofectamine TM  RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) as the transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. A scrambled siRNA was applied as a negative control. Approximately 6 h after transfection, the medium was replaced and the cells were further cultured for 48 h for gene expression analysis by Western blot and qRT-PCR assays. The oligonucleotide sequences of four SMAD4-specific siRNAs and scramble siRNA are supplied in Supplementary Table  6 .\nSite-directed mutagenesis\nPlasmids for human SMAD4 overexpression with a point mutant (R100T) were constructed with a wild-type SMAD4 plasmid (PcDNA3-Flag-SMAD4, Addgene) as a DNA template by using a fast mutagenesis system (TransGen, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting mutant SMAD4 plasmid was confirmed by sequencing (Shenggong, Shanghai, China) to verify the presence of the introduced mutations and the absence of additional unwanted mutations.\nStable transfection for SMAD4 overexpression\nLentivirus vectors were used to establish stably transfected cell lines. Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293T cells for the stable transfection of the cell lines in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The complete coding sequence of the human wild-type SMAD4 or mutant SMAD4 (R100T) gene from the aforementioned mutant or wild-type SMAD4 overexpression vector was cloned into pLV-EF1-CMV- EGFP/T2A/Puro vectors. An empty vector was transfected as control. A total of 3 \u00d7 10 5  BxPC-3 cells in 1 mL of medium with 5 \u00b5g/mL polybrene were infected with 1 mL of lentivirus supernatant.

The efficiency of overexpression in a stable cell line was validated by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays.\nReal-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (real-time qRT-PCR)\nCells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and collected with centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7  g  for 2 min. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration and purity were estimated by Nano-300 Micro-Spectrophotometer (Allsheng Co.,Ltd, Hangzhou, China). cDNA was synthesized with a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Real-time qRT-PCR was conducted with a SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122 II kit (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. mRNA expression was quantified using the 2 -DeltaDeltaCt  method. GAPDH served as an internal control. The PCR conditions were as follows: 42 \u00b0C for 5 min, 95 \u00b0C for 10 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and 60 \u00b0C for 34 s.

Second, we plotted the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve evaluated with an AUC (area under the curve) and took 2.27 (median expression of all the PAAD patients) as the threshold for SMAD4 expression to define the high (>2.27) or low (<2.27) level, followed with Fisher's exact test for calculation of the odds ratio and  p -value.\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. A paired-samples  t -test with two-sided was applied for statistical analyses between two groups, and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons. A value of  p  < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\nReporting summary\nFurther information on research design is available in the  Nature Research Reporting Summary  linked to this article.\n"]}

As shown in Fig.  1a , these lines showed wide variations in gemcitabine susceptibility. Among them, MIA PaCa-2 and HupT-3 cells showed the most sensitivity to gemcitabine, whereas AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were apparently less responsive to the drug. The viability of AsPC-1 cells after gemcitabine treatment was still over 45% even at 100 \u03bcM, implying the strongest resistance to the drug. Fig. 1 Differences in drug susceptibility and PDAC drivers between AsPC-1 cells and MIA PaCa-2 cells. a  Drug responses to gemcitabine of eight human pancreatic cancer cell lines. AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, PANC-1, CFPAC-1, Panc0403, HuPT-3, and SU86.86 cells were exposed to various concentrations of gemcitabine (GEM) for 72 h and cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD from three biologically independent experiments ( n  = 3).  b  The protein expression of KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 in eight pancreatic cancer cell lines was analyzed by Western blot assay, and quantitative evaluation for each line was performed by using ImageJ software. The protein level of beta-actin was used as the internal standard. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments).  c  Differences in protein expression levels in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. The protein expression of EGFR, HER2, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, SMAD7, and TGF-beta was detected by Western blot analysis. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 three biologically independent samples). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with AsPC-1 cells.  p  < 0.01 for TGF-beta,  p  < 0.001 for SMAD4 and SMAD7.  d  Drug responses to either gemcitabine or DTLL between AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of GEM or DTLL for 72 h and cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. The results were obtained from three biologically independent experiments. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with GEM (AsPC-1 cells) and 'b' represents  p  < 0.05 compared with DTLL (AsPC-1 cells).  p  < 0.001 for comparison with GEM at the concentrations of 10 -7 , 10 -6 , 10 -5  and 10 -4 mol/L, and  p  < 0.01 for comparison with GEM at the concentrations of 10 -11 , 10 -9 , 10 -7  and 10 -6  mol/L.  e  ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis to determine the SMAD4 expression level as a predictive tool for clinical gemcitabine response in pancreatic cancer patients ( n  = 108) from public data (TCGA-PAAD project). An ROC curve was plotted for AUC evaluation with the threshold level for SMAD4 expression at 2.27 (median expression of all the PAAD patients) to define the high (>2.27) or low (<2.27) level, followed with Fisher's exact test for calculation of odds ratio and  p -value. Note: For  c  and  d , statistical significance was determined by using two-sided paired-samples  t -test. All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 play key roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of PDAC, as well as gemcitabine susceptibility 10 - 13 . Therefore, we further detected the expression of these four drivers in these eight cell lines. As shown in Fig.  1b , a lack of KRAS expression was detected in all lines except for CFPAC-1 and Panc0403 cells, and CDKN2A was expressed very little among all eight cell lines. There were no apparent differences in KRAS and CDKN2A expression among the gemcitabine-sensitive or gemcitabine-resistant cell lines. Higher levels of TP53 expression were tested in MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, and PANC-1 cells, whereas low expression was observed in other lines, suggesting that the differences in TP53 expression were not predominantly devoted to gemcitabine susceptibility. For instance, HupT-3 cells presented lower levels of TP53 but were sensitive, similar to MIA-PaCa-2 cells, whereas BxPC-3 cells with higher TP53 expression showed less sensitivity than MIA-PaCa-2 cells. Interestingly, SMAD4 was highly expressed in MIA PaCa-2, HupT-3 and PANC-1 cells, whereas little was tested in AsPC-1, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1 cells, implying that the expression might be potentially related to their susceptibility to gemcitabine. Although very significantly different levels of both TP53 and SMAD4 were observed in MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells (Fig.  1b ), the strongest expression of TP53 protein in MIA PaCa-2 cells might be attributed to the gain of function (GOF) mutant TP53 proteins and degradation of normally labile protein in MIA-paca-2 cells 31 . Subsequently, we detected the genetic status of these four drivers in eight cell lines (Table  1 ), and found that the  SMAD4  gene was mutated only in AsPC-1 (R100T mutation) and BxPC-3 (Del) cells. This matched the protein levels in these two lines, as well as the cellular resistance to gemcitabine. Therefore, according to the protein levels and genotypes of those four drivers between MIA PaCa-2/HupT-3 and AsPC-1/BxPC-3 cells, SMAD4 might be the predominant driver contributing to the gemcitabine response in PDAC.

As confirmed in Fig.  1c , SMAD4 protein was highly expressed in MIA PaCa-2 but not AsPC-1 cells. Specifically, the ratios of p-SMAD2/SMAD2, p-SMAD3/SMAD3, SMAD7, p-EGFR/EGFR and p-HER2/HER2 in AsPC-1 cells were obviously higher than those in MIA PaCa-2 cells, showing much more activated TGF-beta/SMADs signaling. Consequently, AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were chosen as in vitro models because of their resistant and sensitive responses to gemcitabine with deficient and sufficient SMAD4 expression, as well as mutant/wild-type genetic status, respectively, to further test the hypothesis that SMAD4 might play a key role in chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer. Simultaneously, we observed the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine and DTLL on the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines. As shown in Fig.  1d , AsPC-1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine than MIA PaCa-2 cells, or DTLL, which was mentioned in our previous study 17 .\nFurthermore, we downloaded the public data (TCGA-PAAD project) of pancreatic cancer patients from TCGA including clinical information on gemcitabine treatment and SMAD4 expression datasets to determine if SMAD4 expression in a PDAC patient is clinically correlated with gemcitabine response. By using the expression level of SMD4 as the criterion for predicting whether a patient is cured, we plotted an ROC curve with an AUC equal to 0.597 (Fig.  1e ). There were 35 patients with high SMAD4 expression, of which 17 (48.57%) samples had a positive drug response, whereas only 34.38% of patients (11 from 32 samples) with a low level of SMAD4 responded positively to gemcitabine. The odds ratio was 1.98 ( p  = 0.22), which indicated that the high level of SMAD4 expression facilitated the gemcitabine response clinically, although the significance level was more than 0.05 perhaps owing to the small sample size.\nTherefore, we demonstrated that SMAD4 was associated with not only PDAC occurrence and progression, but also the drug response to gemcitabine treatment both experimentally and clinically.\nDTLL potentiated the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on cell proliferation and cycle distribution\nTo investigate whether the combination of the two drugs could impact PDAC cell proliferation, we treated gemcitabine-resistant/SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 and gemcitabine-sensitive/SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 cells with gemcitabine, DTLL and both. The results from both MTS (Fig.  2a ) and CyQUANT (Fig.  2b ) assays indicated that the combination of gemcitabine with DTLL obviously inhibited AsPC-1 cell growth compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone. Compared with AsPC-1 cells, gemcitabine alone showed a stronger inhibitory effect in MIA PaCa-2 cells. The combination treatment revealed even more significant inhibition of cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The results in both lines showed that the combination treatment had synergistic effects evaluated by the combination index (CI) < 1 (the threshold line) for both (right panels in Fig.  2 a,  b ), indicating that DTLL effectively sensitized the cell response to gemcitabine. Fig. 2 DTLL potentiated proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest induced by gemcitabine. a  Effects on drug cytotoxicity in AsPC-1 and MIA-paca-2 cells after treatment with GEM, DTLL or both were detected by MTS assays. AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were exposed to a series of concentrations of GEM combined with 10 -10 , 10 -12  and 10 -13  mol/L DTLL for 72 h, respectively. The MTS assay was performed at the end of incubation. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with the GEM group, 'b',  p  < 0.05, compared with the 'GEM + DTLL'(10 -13 ) group, and'c',  p  < 0.05, compared with the 'GEM + DTLL'(10 -12 ) group.  b  The inhibitory effect of GEM and DTLL on cell proliferation in AsPC-1 and MIA-paca-2 cells was measured based on DNA fluorescence using the CyQUANT proliferation assay. The cells were exposed to a series of concentrations of GEM, DTLL or GEM combined with 10 -14  mol/L DTLL for 72 h, respectively. The assay utilizes a fluorescent dye to measure double strand DNA content with a microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission detection at 530 nm. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05, compared with the GEM group.  c  Synergistic effect of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, lapatinib and etoposide with DTLL (10 -12  mol/L) based on MTS assays. The synergistic effect of the combination treatment was evaluated by calculation of the combination index (CI) using the Chou-Talalay method. CI > 1, CI = 1 and CI < 1 indicate antagonistic, additive and synergistic effects, respectively. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3 biologically independent experiments). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05, compared with the 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, lapatinib or etoposide group, respectively.  d  Cell cycle distribution in AsPC-1 and MIA paca-2 cells after treatment with GEM, DTLL or both was detected by flow cytometry assays. In the cell cycle assay, AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with 0.02 \u00b5M gemcitabine, 0.1 nM DTLL or their combination for 24 h. The cell cycle distribution was evaluated using propidium iodide (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD for biologically triplicate experiments. Note :  One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used in  a . For  b ,  c , statistical significance was determined by using two-sided paired-samples  t -test. All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nTo further determine whether DTLL was capable of sensitizing cells to other drugs, we selected multiple antineoplastic agents widely used for pancreatic cancer treatment to detect the effect of DTLL combined with 5-fluorouracil (antimetabolite), oxaliplatin (DNA cross-linking), paclitaxel (anti-microtubule), irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor), etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor) and lapatinib (dual HER2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor), followed by evaluation of the synergistic effect by combination index (CI) calculation. The results (shown in Fig.  2c ) indicated that the combination of DTLL with all the above agents showed more significant antiproliferative effectiveness than either DTLL or those agents alone in both AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. The drug interactions of those agents and DTLL were shown to be synergistic with CIs <1 at those corresponding drug concentrations, except for each treated point of paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan or oxaliplatin. The plots in both AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells indicated that drugs at much higher doses showed less synergistic effects with CI values >1 (right panels in Fig.  2c ). These results suggest that DTLL can effectively sensitize PDAC cells to different types of drugs in addition to gemcitabine.\nSubsequently, we detected the cell cycle distribution in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells treated with PI staining. As shown in Fig.  2d , gemcitabine obviously induced the majority (73.54%) of MIA PaCa-2 cells to arrest at S phase compared to control cells at only 31.38% S phase arrest. However, slightly more AsPC-1 cells treated with gemcitabine arrested at both S (51.73% versus 41.50% in control) and G2/M (14.13% versus 4.26% in control), further suggesting that AsPC-1 cells were resistant to this drug. However, G2/M arrest in both lines was induced by DTLL. In the combined treatment group, G2/M arrest was observed in AsPC-1 cells, whereas an increase in S and G2/M phases of MIA PaCa-2 cells was detected.\nThe above results showed cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition at different levels between the two cell lines by treatments, suggesting the antiproliferative effects of the combination treatment on both lines.\nEffects of DTLL on different signaling pathways in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells\nAfter demonstrating the antiproliferative effects of the combination treatment, we characterized the potential mechanisms of action in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. To investigate inhibitory effects on PDAC cell proliferation and phases of drug treatments, we detected the expression of the apoptotic protein p-Bcl2, the DNA damage marker gammaH2AX and the cell cycle-related protein Cyclin D1. As shown in Fig.  3a , DTLL significantly decreased the expression of p-Bcl2 and Cyclin D1 with increased phosphorylated gammaH2AX in both AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Similar observations were obtained from alterations in those proteins after treatment with gemcitabine. Meanwhile, even more remarkable changes in both lines were observed when treated with both. The results further demonstrated that the combination treatment could eventually induce cellular apoptosis, cycle arrest, and DNA double-strand breaks in gemcitabine-resistant or gemcitabine-sensitive cells. Fig. 3 Functional characterization of gemcitabine, DTLL or combination therapy in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. a ) and TGF-beta/SMADs signaling pathways ( b ) were determined by Western blot assays in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells after treatments with 2 \u00b5M gemcitabine, 0.1 nM DTLL and both at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h.

After treatment, the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions were detected using nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kits. Isolation of the cytosol and nuclei was analyzed by Western blot assay. beta-actin and Lamin B1 were used as the loading controls for the cytosol and nucleus, respectively. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). In AsPC-1 cells,  p  \u2264 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for SMAD4 in the cytoplasm and p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and SMAD4 in the nucleus;  p  \u2264 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus GEM) for SMAD4 in the nucleus;  p  \u2264 0.001 (DTLL versus Control) for p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and SMAD4 in the nucleus;  p  \u2264 0.001 (DTLL versus GEM) for SMAD4 in the nucleus. In MIA PaCa-2 cells,  p  \u2264 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and p-SMAD3/SMAD3 in the cytoplasm, and SMAD4 in the nucleus;  p  \u2264 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus GEM) for p-SMAD3/SMAD3 in the cytoplasm, and p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and SMAD4 in the nucleus;  p  \u2264 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus DTLL) for p-SMAD3/SMAD3 in the cytoplasm;  p  \u2264 0.001 (DTLL versus Control) for p-SMAD3/SMAD3 in the cytoplasm;  p  \u2264 0.001 (GEM versus Control) for p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and p-SMAD3/SMAD3 in the cytoplasm.  d  Immunofluorescence analysis of SMAD4 in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells after treatment with 2 \u00b5M gemcitabine, 0.1 nM DTLL or both at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h using laser scanning confocal microscopy.

Protein levels of EGFR/HER2-dependent signaling pathways, PD-L1 signaling pathways, apoptotic protein Bcl2, DNA damage marker gammaH2AX, cell cycle-related protein Cyclin D1 (\nOur previous study demonstrated that DTLL enhanced DNA damage via EGFR/HER2-dependent blockage of the AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways in gemcitabine-sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells. Hence, to test if these cellular signaling pathways are involved, we treated gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 or gemcitabine-sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells with vehicle, gemcitabine, DTLL or both for 4 h, and further analyzed the ratios of active phosphorylated and total proteins for HER-2, EGFR, ERK1/2, AKT, mTOR, and PD-L1. Interestingly, the responses in the AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways were quite different between AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. After treatment with DTLL or both in MIA PaCa-2 cells, the ratios of active phosphorylated and total EGFR, HER-2, AKT and mTOR proteins were obviously decreased (Fig.  3a ). Furthermore, there were significant decreases in PD-L1 expression, which confirmed our previous findings regarding to DTLL function 25  and suggested similar AKT/mTOR signaling affected by its combination treatment in MIA PaCa-2 cells. In contrast, the ratios of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-HER-2/HER-2, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR were significantly increased in AsPC-1 cells. Furthermore, an apparent increase in PD-L1 expression was observed in AsPC-1 cells, indicating that there were obviously different molecular mechanisms by which these two cells differed in drug response to the combination therapy. In addition, no changes in ERK1/2 expression in either of the two cell lines were found.\nWe further explored whether other molecular signaling pathways were triggered by the combination treatment in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Total differences in TGF-beta/SMADs signaling proteins were observed between those two lines, including SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, SMAD7, and TGF-beta levels. The data shown in Fig.  3b  indicated that treatment with DTLL alone or in combination with gemcitabine induced the expression of SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 in SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 cells, while a marked decrease in SMAD7 expression was observed. This result indicated that, unlike MIA PaCa-2 cells, DTLL might restore SMAD4 expression by inhibiting SMAD7 in AsPC-1 cells, leading to significant reactivation of SMAD4-dependent signaling. In contrast, DTLL alone or in combination with gemcitabine significantly decreased the expression of SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 in SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 cells, but they markedly increased the expression of SMAD7. We speculated that immediate activation of inhibitory SMADs (SMAD7) in MIA PaCa-2 cells might form a complex with SMAD2/3, thereby interfering with the complex formation between SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 32 , and preventing further signal propagation. Therefore, the above results demonstrated that the combination treatment had opposite effects on the TGF-beta/SMADs signaling pathways of PDAC cells in a SMAD4-dependent manner.\nSubsequently, we detected differences in the effects of DTLL on the translocation of SMAD4 induced from the cytosol to the nucleus in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins of AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were extracted after treatments to detect the distribution of SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 in parallel Western blot assays (Fig.  3c ). The results showed that the phosphorylated forms of SMAD2/SMAD3 and SMAD4 were significantly increased in the nucleus of AsPC-1 cells treated with either DTLL or both, but decreased in the cytoplasm. However, there were significant decreases in the ratios of p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and p-SMAD3/SMAD3, as well as decreased SMAD4 in the nucleus of MIA PaCa-2 cells after treatment with DTLL or both. In the MIA PaCa-2 cytoplasm, we found an increase in SMAD4 and enhanced ratios of p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and p-SMAD3/SMAD3 in cells treated by DTLL or both. As the results from the immunofluorescence assay show in Fig.  3d , the combination treatment, similar to DTLL, significantly increased the nuclear accumulation of SMAD4 in AsPC-1 cells, but suppressed its accumulation in the MIA PaCa-2 nucleus. We demonstrated that the SMAD-dependent signaling pathway was reactivated by DTLL or combination therapy, contributing to increases in the inhibition of SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 cell growth. However, similar drug responses but controversial alterations in this pathway were observed in SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 cells.\nDownregulation or upregulation of SMAD4 altered PDAC susceptibility to gemcitabine\nSince we have found a relationship between the gemcitabine response and SMAD4 protein levels, we altered SMAD4 expression by transiently transfecting either a specific siRNA or overexpression vector of SMAD4 into pancreatic cancer cells to detect the effect of SMAD4 expression levels on PDAC cellular susceptibility to gemcitabine. As shown in Fig.  4a , downregulation of SMAD4 at both mRNA and protein levels in MIA PaCa-2 cells that carry the wild-type  SMAD4  gene with high protein levels significantly reduced cell sensitivity to gemcitabine after exposure to various concentrations for 72 h. In contrast, SMAD4 overexpression apparently sensitized AsPC-1 cells carrying the R100T mutation with little SMAD4 protein expression to gemcitabine (Fig.  4b ). The results indicated that SMAD4 contributed to the cellular response to gemcitabine in PDAC cells. However, it might be involved in distinct action mechanisms owing to different genotypes and protein levels of SMAD4 in MIA PaCa-2 versus AsPC-1 cells. Fig. 4 Downregulation or upregulation of SMAD4 altered PDAC susceptibility to gemcitabine. a  Downregulation of SMAD4 reduced the sensitivity of MIA PaCa-2 cells to gemcitabine. After knocking down SMAD4 with its specific siRNAs, the mRNA and protein levels of  SMAD4  were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. MIA PaCa-2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of GEM for 72 h and cell viability was measured by MTS assay. The results were obtained from three independent experiments. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). A pooled siRNA against SMAD4 (siSMAD4) and a scramble siRNA (siNC) indicate siRNA targeting SMAD4 and its negative control, respectively.

After SMAD4 was upregulated by its overexpression vector, the mRNA and protein levels of  SMAD4  in AsPC-1 cells were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. The AsPC-1 cell line was exposed to various concentrations of GEM for 72 h, and cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. The results were obtained from three independent experiments.

When treated with DTLL,  p  < 0.001 for all time points except for 0, 0.25 and 0.5 h; When treated with CHX + DTLL,  p  < 0.001 for 1, 24, 36, and 48 h. Note: All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. For  a ,  b ,  e , statistical significance was determined by using two-sided Paired-samples t - test. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used in  c . Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nDifferences in the protein degradation of wild-type and mutant SMAD4 in PDAC cells and DTLL impact\nTo further test if the effect of SMAD4 genetic status on its expression, we performed qRT-PCR and Western blot assays to detect differences in  SMAD4  mRNA expression among BxPC-3 (deleted  SMAD4 ), MIA PaCa-2 (wild-type  SMAD4 ) and AsPC-1 (R100T mutant  SMAD4 ) cells, as well as that in protein degradation.  SMAD4  mRNA and protein expression was not detectable in BxPC-3 cells, consistent with its genetic status. With obviously higher levels of  SMAD4  mRNA in MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells, there was no significant difference between those two lines (left panel in Fig.  4c ). However, SMAD4 protein expression in MIA PaCa-2 cells was much higher than that in AsPC-1 cells (right panel in Fig.  4c ). The above result implied that SMAD4 genetic status is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels.\nFurthermore, mutant SMAD4 protein in AsPC-1 cells had much shorter half-life of only approximately one hour, showing rapid protein degradation after 24 h of treatment with cycloheximide (CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor), compared to the prolonged wild-type protein in MIA PaCa-2 cells even after 72 h of CHX treatment (Fig.  4d ). Interestingly, with the induction of DTLL, mutant protein degradation of SMAD4 in AsPC-1 cells was significantly retarded, with a dramatic 9-fold-increase in its protein level even after 48 h of CHX treatment compared to the control at the beginning time point. The wild-type SMAD4 protein in MIA PaCa-2 cells also showed a slight increase with the induction of DTLL (Fig.  4e ). In addition, SMAD4 protein degradation was not observed and induced by DTLL in BxPC-3 cells (Fig.  4 d,  e ). This suggests that DTLL might significantly enhance the expression level of SMAD4, especially in SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 cells, and thus resensitize the cellular response to gemcitabine or other chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, BxPC-3 cells without SMAD4 mRNA and protein expression were suitable for creating wild-type and mutant SMAD4 overexpression vectors in follow-up studies.\nEvaluation of in vivo efficacy in CDX models from AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells\nNext, we determined whether there was a difference in the effect of SMAD4 between wild-type and mutant proteins on gemcitabine efficacy in vivo, and how DTLL or its combinational therapy influenced the growth of tumors expressing these two different SMAD4. The above two AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 lines, serving as SMAD4-mutant/deficient and SMAD4-wild-type/sufficient PDAC cells, were used to generate in vivo CDX mouse models for evaluation of the antineoplastic efficacy of vehicle, gemcitabine or DTLL alone, and the combination. As shown in Fig. S 1 a, AsPC-1 xenografts had much higher expression of p-EGFR and p-SMAD2/SMAD2, p-SMAD3/SMAD3, SMAD7 but lack of SMAD4 and TGF-beta expression, as compared to the MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model, further confirming the results from the in vitro observations.\nIn the AsPC-1 xenograft model (shown in Fig.  5a  and Supplementary Table  1 ), gemcitabine had a minimal inhibitory effect at 26.05% and DTLL slightly repressed tumor growth by 39.80%. However, the combination of gemcitabine and DTLL had remarkable synergistic efficacy with a significant tumor inhibition rate of 66.96% in the AsPC-1 xenograft model. As shown in Fig.  5b  and Supplementary Table  1 , tumor growth of MIA PaCa-2 CDX models was obviously inhibited in all treatment groups compared with the control. Specifically, gemcitabine or DTLL alone was able to apparently inhibit tumor growth of MIA PaCa-2 models by 59.04% or 79.62%, respectively. The combination treatment significantly repressed tumor growth by 88.15%. In addition, no deaths or significant changes in body weight were observed (Fig. S 2 a and S 2b ) in treated mice, and no toxic-pathological organs were observed (Fig. S 3 a and S 3b ) as compared to the control group. Fig. 5 Evaluation of in vivo efficacy by cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models of human pancreatic cancer. a ) and MIA PaCa-2 ( b ). In both CDX models, the mice received an equal volume of physiological saline (control group), 60 mg/kg gemcitabine intraperitoneally administered once a week (GEM group), 0.05 mg/kg DTLL at the LDM-equivalent dose intravenously administered (DTLL group) every ten days, and the same dosing administration for either DTLL or gemcitabine (GEM + DTLL group). Tumor volume in each group was measured and calculated for comparison between 'GEM + DTLL'versus other groups. Data are representative of biologically independent replicates as the mean \u00b1 SEM ( n  = 6 for AsPC-1 and  n  = 5 for MIA PaCa-2 tumors). In AsPC-1 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23;  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus GEM) for day 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23. In MIA PaCa-2 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 9, 12, 19, and 22.  c  Protein expression levels in tumor tissue samples from either AsPC-1 or MIA PaCa-2 models after treatment with GEM, DTLL or both were determined by Western blot assay. Band intensities were quantified using Image J. Data are displayed as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent replicates). In AsPC-1 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 for SMAD4 between 'GEM + DTLL' versus Control, 'GEM + DTLL' versus GEM or DTLL versus GEM groups;  p  < 0.001 for p-Akt/Akt between DTLL versus Control groups. In MIA PaCa-2 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 for SMAD7 between DTLL versus Control groups.  d  IHC staining of Ki-67 in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 xenograft models (\u00d7100).

The results were observed by an inverted microscope using DAB as a chromogenic reagent. Images are representative of three biologically independent replicates with a scale bar representing 50 \u03bcm ( n  = 3). In either AsPC-1 or MIA PaCa-2 tumors,  p  < 0.001 between 'GEM + DTLL '  versus Control, as well as DTLL versus GEM. In AsPC-1 tumors,  p  < 0.001 between GEM versus Control groups.  e  Apoptotic cells in the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 models were measured in TUNEL assay (\u00d7200 ) . Apoptotic cells in tumor tissue were determined by the TUNEL method according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope. Red fluorescence represents the positive cells. Images are representative of three biologically independent replicates with a scale bar indicating 25 \u03bcm ( n  = 3). In both AsPC-1 tumors and MIA PaCa-2 tumors,  p  < 0.001 when compared 'GEM + DTLL'versus all three Control, GEM and DTLL groups. In MIA PaCa-2 tumors,  p  < 0.001 (DTLL versus Control, or GEM versus Control). Note: For  a - e , 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with the control, 'b',  p  < 0.05 compared with the GEM group and 'c',  p  < 0.05 compared with the DTLL group.

For  a-e , statistical significance was determined by using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. Source data are provided in the Source Data fil e . Inhibitory effect on tumor growth of cells treated with gemcitabine, DTLL and both by using two CDX models of AsPC-1 (\nAfter mice were sacrificed, we further detected any alterations in the protein expression of tumor tissue samples in Western blot assays to confirm our results from the above in vitro functional studies, and thereby shed light on its therapeutic efficacy. For SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 tumor models, the ratios of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-HER-2/HER-2, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR as well as PD-L1 expression were more effectively inhibited after treatment with DTLL or both than in gemcitabine or control-treated groups, whereas slightly decreased SMAD4 and dramatically increased SMAD7 were observed. These data implied that combination treatment enhanced antineoplastic efficacy via EGFR/HER2-dependent blockade of AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways in MIA PaCa-2 xenografts, consistent with the above in vitro results as well as our previous findings of DTLL 25 . In contrast, in either DTLL or the combination treatment group of SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 models (shown in Fig.  5c ), significantly increased expression of SMAD2/SMAD3 and SMAD4, as well as decreased SMAD7 were tested when compared to the control or gemcitabine, suggesting that DTLL combined with gemcitabine could obviously reactivate SMAD4, and thereby inhibit AsPC-1 tumor growth in a SMAD-dependent manner. Moreover, we detected significant increases in the ratios of active phosphorylated and total proteins for EGFR, HER-2, AKT, and PD-L1, as well as little alteration in p-mTOR/mTOR with gemcitabine or the combination treatment. In contrast to the effect on SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 tumors, DTLL inhibited the growth of SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 tumors but not by blocking the EGFR/AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways.\nIHC staining of Ki-67 with semiquantification displayed a remarkable antiproliferative effect on tumor cells in the combination treatment group when compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone (Fig.  5d ), as well as greater apoptosis in the TUNEL assay (Fig.  5e ). Our results suggested that the combination treatment showed highly potent efficacy by using in vivo CDX models compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone.\nEvaluation of in vivo efficacy by PDX models of human pancreatic cancer\nPDX models derived from fresh human tumor tissue have been widely used to evaluate the pharmacological efficacy of various therapeutic agents and to predict their clinical implementation in the future as an effective study tool for translational medicine 33 . Therefore, to further investigate the antitumor effects of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine, we selected two PDX models (PA1233 and PA3142) as SMAD4-mutant/deficient and SMAD4-wild-type/sufficient models, based on SMAD4 genetic status obtained from available RNA sequencing datasets ( https://models.crownbio.com/pancreatic-cancer/ ) and protein levels by using Western blot assays (Fig. S 1b ). Similar to the profiles of AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 tumors (Table  1 , Fig.S 1a ), the  SMAD4  gene in PA1233 tumors was mutated (D537Y and E171D) with obviously lower protein levels whereas higher expression was shown in PA3142 due to the wild-type  SMAD4 . Moreover, higher expression levels of EGFR and HER2 were detected in PA3142 models than in PA1233. These two PDX models had previously shown different responses to gemcitabine validated from the report of the company where PA1233 tumors were resistant to gemcitabine with a very slower growth rate and PA3142 models were sensitive with tumors rapidly developed ( https://models.crownbio.com/pancreatic-cancer/ ). As shown in Supplementary Table  1 , the results from the in vivo evaluation of efficacy in PA1233 models indicated that the inhibitory rate of tumor volume on day 28 at the end of the experiment was only 11.65% and 31.54% for gemcitabine and DTLL alone, respectively. However, the combination therapy obviously improved the antineoplastic effect with a 72.25% inhibition rate. As observed in Fig.  6a , in the SMAD4-deficient PA1233 model with the combination treatment, there were significantly superior antineoplastic effects achieved when compared with the gemcitabine or DTLL alone group. In the SMAD4-sufficient PA3142 models, the inhibitory rates of gemcitabine and DTLL were 54.37% and 50.50%, respectively. The combination treatment significantly repressed tumors at 77.17% (Fig.  6b ). The results showed that the combination treatment exhibited highly potent efficacy in both SMAD4-mutant/deficient and SMAD4-wild-type/sufficient PDX models compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone. Fig. 6 Evaluation of in vivo efficacy by patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human pancreatic cancer. a ) and PA3142 ( b ) on tumor growth. In both PDX models, the mice were received equal volumes of physiological saline (control group), 60 mg/kg gemcitabine every four days (GEM group), 0.05 mg/kg DTLL once a week (DTLL group) and 60 mg/kg gemcitabine combined with 0.025 mg/kg DTLL (GEM + DTLL group). Data are representative of biologically independent replicates as the mean \u00b1 SEM ( n  = 3 for PA1233 and  n  = 4 for PA3142 tumors). In PA3142 model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 14 and 17.  c  Protein expression levels in tumor tissue samples from PA1233 or PA3142 models after treatments with GEM, DTLL or both were determined by Western blot assays. Band intensities were quantified using Image J. Data are displayed as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent replicates). In PA1233 PDX model,  p  < 0.001 for PD-L1 between DTLL versus Control or DTLL versus GEM;  p  < 0.001 for SMAD4 between 'GEM + DTLL' versus Control, DTLL versus Control or DTLL versus GEM. In PA3142 PDX model,  p  < 0.001 for SMAD4 between 'GEM + DTLL' versus Control, 'GEM + DTLL' versus GEM, DTLL versus Control or DTLL versus GEM; p < 0.001 for SMAD7 between 'GEM + DTLL' versus Control, 'GEM + DTLL' versus GEM or DTLL versus GEM.  d  IHC staining of Ki-67 in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from either the PA1233 or PA3142 models (\u00d7100).

Inhibitory effect of gemcitabine, DTLL and both in two PDX models of PA1233 (\nSubsequently, we investigated the drug effects on the expression of relevant proteins in the AKT/mTOR and TGFbeta/SMADs signaling pathways in the two PDX models. Similar results were observed (Fig.  6c ), in which the combination treatment exhibited similar inhibitory trends in the ratios of p-EGFR/EGFR and pHER2/HER2 in both models. However, the combination significantly upregulated the protein levels of SMAD4 and PD-L1 in PA1233 tumors and downregulated these two proteins in PA3142 models (Fig.  6c ). In addition, there were no obvious effects on the p-mTOR/mTOR ratios detected in the PA1233 tumors whereas significantly decreased ratios of p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR were observed in PA3142 tumors treated with DTLL and both. Tumor specimens were tested for IHC staining of Ki-67 and apoptosis in the TUNEL assay with semiquantification (Fig.  6 d,  e ). Similar results were observed with significantly downregulated Ki-67 but increased apoptosis in the combination treatment group as compared to the gemcitabine or DTLL alone group. The above results further demonstrated that the combination treatment showed high inhibitory efficacy with distinct alterations in cell signaling pathways in a SMAD4-dependent manner.\nEvaluation of gemcitabine efficacy in BxPC-3 cells with stably expressing wild-type and mutant SMAD4 in vitro and in vivo\nAs we mentioned above, BxPC-3 cells do not express SMAD4 mRNA or protein of owing to gene deletion. Therefore, we used this cell line to generate three types of stably transfected cells containing empty control, mutant, and wild-type SMAD4 overexpression vectors after creating the mutant SMAD4 overexpression vector via site-mutagenesis assay (Fig.  7a ) to further test the different effects of wild-type and mutant SMAD4 on drug efficacy. There was no apparent difference in the mRNA level of  SMAD4  in BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cells, while there was a much lower level of mutant protein than wild-type one, as detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays (Fig.  7b ,  c ).

Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD from three biologically independent replicates (n = 3). As compared 'GEM + DTLL' to GEM,  p  < 0.001 for 10 -9  mol/L of GEM in BxPC3-EV cells,  p  < 0.001 at 10 -13  mol/L in BxPC3-WT cells, and  p  < 0.001 at 10 -11 , 10 -12  and 10 -13  mol/L in BxPC3-Mut cells.  g  Cell cycle distribution in BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut stably transfected cells after treated with GEM, DTLL or both was detected by flow cytometry assays.

The cell cycle distribution was evaluated using propidium iodide (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are representative of biologically independent triplicates ( n  = 3).  h  Inhibitory effect on tumor growth of treatments with gemcitabine, DTLL and both in these three CDX models derived from BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut cells. In those models, the mice received an equal volume of physiological saline (control group), 30 mg/kg gemcitabine intraperitoneally administered every four days (GEM group), 0.075 mg/kg DTLL at the LDM-equivalent dose intravenously administered once a week (DTLL group) and 30 mg/kg gemcitabine combined with 0.075 mg/kg DTLL ('GEM + DTLL'group). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM for biologically independent replicates as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 5). In BxPC3-EV CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 27, 30 and 33. In BxPC3-WT CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33. In BxPC3- Mut CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL' versus Control) for day 24, 27, 30, and 33;  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL' versus GEM) for day 27, 30, and 33;  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus DTLL) for day 30. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used in  b ,  d ,  h ; Paired-samples  t -test was two-sided and used in  e  and  f . All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nWe further evaluated the in vitro inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on the growth of BxPC-3 cells with empty vector (BxPC3-EV), wild-type (BxPC3-WT) and mutant (BxPC3-Mut) overexpression vectors. As shown in Fig.  7d , BxPC3-WT cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine than BxPC3 mock or BxPC3-EV cells, but BxPC3-Mut cells showed little difference from those two. Gemcitabine or DTLL alone, and their combination were tested for proliferative inhibition of BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut cells by using MTS and CyQUANT assays (Fig.  7e ,  f ), respectively. The results indicated that the combination of gemcitabine with DTLL showed the most significant inhibition rate of tumor cell growth when compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone, obviously showing a synergistic effect evaluated by CI calculation, not a simple additive effect. In addition, the results from the cytometry assay (Fig.  7g ) showed that more G1/S arrest was observed in BxPC3-WT cells treated with gemcitabine than in the other two types of cells, partly explaining the sensitivity of BxPC3-WT cells overexpressing SMAD4 to gemcitabine. However, DTLL or its combination therapy significantly induced an increase in G2/M cells in both BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut lines. This further confirmed that DTLL potentiated the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on cell proliferation and cycle distribution.\nNext, we used the above BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT, and BxPC3-Mut stably transfected cell lines to generate in vivo CDX mouse models for evaluation of antineoplastic efficacy of vehicle, gemcitabine or DTLL alone, and the combination. As shown in Fig.  7h  and Supplementary Table  2 , gemcitabine had a minimal inhibitory effect on BxPC3-Mut tumors at 7.46% and DTLL slightly repressed tumor growth by 47.61%, however, the combination of gemcitabine and DTLL had remarkable synergistic efficacy with a tumor inhibition rate of 78.62% in this gemcitabine-resistant xenograft model. In the BxPC3-WT models, gemcitabine or DTLL alone was able to apparently inhibit tumor growth by 65.33% or 59.19%, respectively, suggesting its sensitivity to both drugs. The combination treatment significantly repressed tumor growth by 82.06%. In addition, there were no deaths or significant changes in body weight observed in treated mice (Fig. S 2c ), as well as no toxic-pathological organs (Fig. S 3c ), compared to the control group. This further confirmed the synergistic inhibitory effect of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine on in vivo tumor growth, similar to the above results obtained in both CDX and PDX models.\nAll the above results demonstrated that different SMAD4 genetic statuses in PDAC cells are responsible for distinct protein levels between mutant and wild-type SMAD4. Expression has been proven to affect cellular susceptibility to gemcitabine by using ex/in vivo MIA PaCa-2, AsPC-1, and BxPC-3 cell lines or CDX/PDX mouse models with either mutant or wild-type SMAD4 expression. We confirmed that DTLL sensitizes gemcitabine efficacy in those models, and further conducted functional characterization in follow-up studies with the above BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT. and BxPC3-Mut stably transfected cell lines.\nDistinct protein levels and half-life times of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 with/without DTLL induction in BxPC-3 cells\nThere was no apparent difference in  SMAD4  mRNA levels between AsPC-1 vs. MIA PaCa-2 (left panel in Fig.  4c ) and BxPC3-Mut vs. BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  7b ), indicating no impact on  SMAD4  mRNA transcription affected by the R100T mutation. Therefore, we tested whether there was a difference in protein degradation between mutant and wild-type SMAD4 in BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut stably transfected cell lines by Western blot assays, followed with DTLL treatment. The results demonstrated that the mutant SMAD4 protein was degraded rapidly (Fig.  8a ) but dramatically induced by DTLL (Fig.  8b ) in BxPC3-Mut cells, whereas wild-type SMAD4 remained much longer and showed a slight increase via DTLL treatment in BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8 a,  b ), consistent with the results from the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 lines (Fig.  4 d,  e ). TRIM33 protein, as a specific E3 ligase for SMAD4 ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation, was steeply decreased in BxPC3-WT cells after being treated with DTLL from 0, 0.25 till 8 h. However, its level maintained even for 24 h if given DTLL induction and gradually started to decrease in BxPC3-Mut cells (Fig.  8b ), which in part explained why the degradation velocity of mutant SMAD4 was significantly retarded if given DTLL induction. Next, we tested the protein levels of SMAD4 after cotreatment with CHX to exclude the influence of DTLL induction on protein synthesis and further demonstrated more significant induction of SMAD4 via DTLL in BxPC3-Mut cells than in BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8c ). This result confirmed that SMAD4 genetic status is responsible for SMAD4 protein expression and that the difference in TRIM33 mediated proteasome degradation between mutant and wild-type proteins partially contributed to their distinguished protein levels. Moreover, DTLL significantly prolonged the half-life time by inhibiting SMAD4 degradation but impacted wild-type and mutant proteins to different degrees, thereby reactivating SMAD4 function with restored proteins, especially in BxPC3-Mut cells, consequently leading to enhanced cellular susceptibility to gemcitabine.

As shown in Fig.  8d , both the BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut lines had decreased expression of p-EGFR, EGFR, p-HER2, and HER2. Similar to the observation in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, significant decreases in p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR expression were observed in BxPC3-WT cells, while an increase in p-AKT/AKT was detected in BxPC3-Mut cells. However, there was significantly induced expression of SMAD4, p-SMAD2/SMAD2, p-SMAD3/SMAD3, and TGF-beta, but an apparent decrease in SMAD7 in the BxPC3-Mut lines compared to the BxPC3-WT lines (Fig.  8d ), further confirming the results from the observations in the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 lines (Fig.  3 a,  b ).\nNext, we tested changes in cell cycle relevant proteins to determine if DTLL affected the expression level of any protein mediated by SMAD4. With DTLL or its combination treatment, the expression levels of cyclin D3, cyclin B1, CDK2, phos-CDC2, phos-Wee1, and P27 were reduced in both the BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT lines (Fig.  8e ). However, significantly increased expression of P21, cyclin E2 and CDK4 in the BxPC3-Mut line was observed, while decreases in those proteins were detected in the BxPC3-WT line (Fig.  8e ).\nInterestingly, we found that the expression levels of phospho-P65, P65, and P50 units of NF-\u03baB, a well-known transcription factor, were induced significantly by DTLL or its combination in the BxPC3-Mut line. Along with increased mutant SMAD4 by DTLL induction, apoptotic proteins including BAX, FADD, and cleaved caspase-8 were significantly induced, while anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and MCL1 proteins were reduced (Fig.  8f ). Moreover, the semiquantification results in BxPC3-Mut cells demonstrated that there were significant decreases in the ratio of Bcl-2/BAX and MCL1/BAX after treatment with DTLL or its combination compared to the control, indicating the consequence of enhanced cell apoptosis by DTLL. On the other hand, in the BxPC3-WT line, all the above proteins were apparently reduced with decreased SMAD4, except for induced cleaved caspase-8 (Fig.  8f ). The results from semiquantification in the BxPC3-WT line also demonstrated the consequence of cell apoptosis with significant decreases in the ratio of Bcl-2/BAX and MCL1/BAX after treated by DTLL or its combination compared to the control. The directions of the changes in SMAD4 and NF-\u03baB expression induced by DTLL, as well as the expression of their targeted apoptotic/anti-apoptotic proteins, were opposite between the BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut lines, but eventually led to the consequence of enhanced cell apoptosis and sensitized drug response.\nMoreover, to determine if the expression of apoptotic (BAX, FADD) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and MCL1) proteins was transcriptionally regulated by NF-\u03baB mediated via either mutant or wild-type SMAD4, we tested their mRNA levels in the same cell samples by qRT-PCR. Indeed, the mRNA levels of P50, P65, BAX, and FADD as SMAD4 targets were obviously upregulated along with the same increasing tendency at the  SMAD4  mRNA level in BxPC3-Mut cells when treated with DTLL or the combination, as compared to the control or gemcitabine-treated cells, implying that SMAD4 directly promoted its downstream target NF-\u03baB which further regulated BAX and FADD expression as a regulatory transcription. However, slight decreases in Bcl-2 and MCL1 expression were detected in DTLL-treated cells, independent of NF-\u03baB regulation promoted by SMAD4. On the other hand, along with little change in  SMAD4  mRNA expression in BxPC3-WT cells treated with DTLL or the combination, the mRNA levels of P50, BAX, Bcl-2, and MCL1 were significantly lower than those in the control or gemcitabine-treated cells, (Fig.  8g ). The results suggested that, in BxPC3-WT cells, decreased NF-\u03baB was upstream of BAX, Bcl-2, and MCL1 but not transcriptionally regulated by SMAD4, and DTLL altered NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity but did not affect its expression through SMAD4.\nThese alterations in the mRNA levels of these two lines were largely consistent with the above results from the Western blot assay (Fig.  8f ). In addition, all of the above relevant proteins were detected for validating their basic expression profiles in the BxPC3-EV, -WT and -Mut cells (Fig. S 4 ).\nDifferent protein interactions of mutant or wild-type SMAD4 with/without DTLL induction in BxPC-3 cells\nThe results from the co-IP assay further indicated that both mutant and wild-type SMAD4 proteins were able to interact with P50 and P65 (Fig.  8h ), which implied that SMAD4 might impact on the transcriptional bioactivity of NF-\u03baB, which was further responsible for regulating the expression of the above mRNAs and proteins in both BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut cells. Moreover, the interactions of wild-type SMAD4 with P50 and P65 were significantly inhibited in BxPC3-WT cells after treated by DTLL but were apparently increased in DTLL-treated BxPC3-Mut cells (Fig.  8i ). This might explain the reason for the difference intendancies in the downstream gene expression affected by NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity between those two cell lines after treated by DTLL. Owing to the increased bioactivity of mutant SMAD4-mediated NF-\u03baB given DTLL, apoptotic BAX and FADD proteins were significantly induced and resulted in cell death (increased cleaved caspase-8). However, the transcriptional bioactivity of NF-\u03baB promoted by wild-type SMAD4 was inhibited by DTLL, and thus anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) were downregulated, mainly responsible for the increase in programmed cell death (enhanced cleaved caspase-8).\nIn accordance with the results of TRIM33 alteration over the time course shown in Fig.  8b , the mRNA and protein levels of TRIM33 in BxPC3-Mut cells were decreased but not as significantly as those in BxPC3-WT cells after treatment with DTLL for 24 h (Fig.  8 f,  g ). This result suggested that TRIM33 was not regulated by SMAD4, and seemed to be the feedback of either mutant or wild-type SMAD4 expression. We also demonstrated the interaction of TRIM33 with either mutant or wild-type SMAD4 proteins (Fig.  8h ). The interaction between wild-type SMAD4 and TRIM33 was significantly inhibited in BxPC3-WT cells after treatment with DTLL, while their interaction was apparently increased in DTLL-treated BxPC3-Mut cells (Fig.  8i ). Different levels of TRIM33 expression in both cell lines were decreased but to different degrees. Therefore, we speculated that, in BxPC3-WT cells with high levels of wild-type SMAD4 expression, TRIM33 was responsible for its degradation to a certain degree and interacted with SMAD4 to maintain its expression balance. If given DTLL or its combination treatment, TRIM33 was reduced rapidly within 8 h with its apparently impaired interaction with wild-type SMAD4 to retard its degradation and maintain its expression balance. However, little expression of mutant SMAD4 in BxPC3-Mut cells was accompanied by a low level of TRIM33 which mediates its proteasome degradation. With DTLL or its combination treatments, TRIM33 was decreased at slower and lower velocities, thus resulting in very slow degradation of mutant SMAD4 and increased accumulation of SMAD4 protein expression. Consequently, the increased accumulation of mutant SMAD4 expression is accompanied by its significantly enhanced interaction with TRIM33 by DTLL to compensate for its degradation for a balance.\nDifferent proteomic and gemcitabine pharmacokinetic profiles in mutant and wild-type SMAD4 cells with/without DTLL induction in BxPC-3 cells\nIn addition, we further performed a proteomic study to determine if SMAD4 has effects on the expression of gemcitabine-relevant transporters or pharmacokinetic enzymes. All the proteomic raw data and the results files have been uploaded to the iProX Consortium ( https://www.iprox.org/ ) with PXD identifiers (PXD031977). As shown in the heatmap (left panel of Fig.  8j ) and Supplementary Data  3 , the proteomic profiles of BxPC3-Mut and -WT cells without any treatments were quite distinct and showed fewer changes after gemcitabine treated both lines, respectively. DTLL or its combination obviously altered the profile of BxPC3-Mut cells compared to the control or gemcitabine-induced profile, unlike BxPC3-WT cells. Next, we found a total of 12 proteins of gemcitabine-relevant transporters or pharmacokinetic enzymes detectable (Supplementary Table  3 ), including ABCC1, CDA, CDC5L, CMPK1, DCK, DCTD, NT5C, NT5C2, NT5C3A, RRM1, RRM2, and SLC29A1. Except for DCK, DCTD, NT5C2 and NT5C3A, all the other nine proteins were significantly altered, as shown in the expression heatmap (right panel of Fig.  8j ) between BxPC3-Mut versus BxPC3-WT cells after treatments. The expression of SMAD4 was included as a positive control, which confirmed that SMAD4 expression alterations (Ratio  Mut/WT  = 0.017,  p  = 7.3 \u00d7 10 -5 ), similar to the results in Western blot assay. Specifically, the expression of RRM2 was much lower in BxPC3-Mut cells than in BxPC3-WT cells (Ratio  Mut/WT  = 0.22,  p  = 2.24 \u00d7 10 -6 ), and was significantly induced after treated with DTLL and its combination, with a similar altered trend of SMAD4 in those cells. The proteomic results implied that SMAD4 status significantly impacted the proteomic profiles as a result of chemoresistance properties that DTLL might also affect the proteomic profiles of both lines, and that it altered cellular susceptibility via RRM2 induction regulated by SMAD4 in BxPC3-Mut cells.\nAll the above results suggested different action mechanisms of DTLL enhancing cellular susceptibility on the basis of SMAD4 genetic or expression status in BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cells, respectively, thereby shedding light on its synergistic therapeutic efficacy.\n"], "ner": [[[66, 70,

stratify different drug responses to gemcitabine of common PDAC cell lines available in the lab and select cell models suitable for our follow-up experiments, we first performed MTS assays using 8 human lines including AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, PANC-1, CFPAC-1, Panc0403, HuPT-3, and SU86.86 cells. As shown in Fig.  1a , these lines showed wide variations in gemcitabine susceptibility. Among them, MIA PaCa-2 and HupT-3 cells showed the most sensitivity to gemcitabine, whereas AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were apparently less responsive to the drug. The viability of AsPC-1 cells after gemcitabine treatment was still over 45% even at 100 \u03bcM, implying the strongest resistance to the drug. Fig. 1 Differences in drug susceptibility and PDAC drivers between AsPC-1 cells and MIA PaCa-2 cells. a  Drug responses to gemcitabine of eight human pancreatic cancer cell lines. AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, PANC-1, CFPAC-1, Panc0403, HuPT-3, and SU86.86 cells were exposed to various concentrations of gemcitabine (GEM) for 72 h and cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD from three biologically independent experiments ( n  = 3).  b  The protein expression of KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 in eight pancreatic cancer cell lines was analyzed by Western blot assay, and quantitative evaluation for each line was performed by using ImageJ software. The protein level of beta-actin was used as the internal standard. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments).  c  Differences in protein expression levels in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. The protein expression of EGFR, HER2, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, SMAD7, and TGF-beta was detected by Western blot analysis. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 three biologically independent samples). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with AsPC-1 cells.  p  < 0.01 for TGF-beta,  p  < 0.001 for SMAD4 and SMAD7.  d  Drug responses to either gemcitabine or DTLL between AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of GEM or DTLL for 72 h and cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. The results were obtained from three biologically independent experiments. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with GEM (AsPC-1 cells) and 'b' represents  p  < 0.05 compared with DTLL (AsPC-1 cells).  p  < 0.001 for comparison with GEM at the concentrations of 10 -7 , 10 -6 , 10 -5  and 10 -4 mol/L, and  p  < 0.01 for comparison with GEM at the concentrations of 10 -11 , 10 -9 , 10 -7  and 10 -6  mol/L.  e  ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis to determine the SMAD4 expression level as a predictive tool for clinical gemcitabine response in pancreatic cancer patients ( n  = 108) from public data (TCGA-PAAD project). An ROC curve was plotted for AUC evaluation with the threshold level for SMAD4 expression at 2.27 (median expression of all the PAAD patients) to define the high (>2.27) or low (<2.27) level, followed with Fisher's exact test for calculation of odds ratio and  p -value. Note: For  c  and  d , statistical significance was determined by using two-sided paired-samples  t -test. All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4 play key roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of PDAC, as well as gemcitabine susceptibility 10 - 13 . Therefore, we further detected the expression of these four drivers in these eight cell lines. As shown in Fig.  1b , a lack of KRAS expression was detected in all lines except for CFPAC-1 and Panc0403 cells, and CDKN2A was expressed very little among all eight cell lines. There were no apparent differences in KRAS and CDKN2A expression among the gemcitabine-sensitive ", "or gemcitabine-resistant cell lines. Higher levels of TP53 expression were tested in MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, and PANC-1 cells, whereas low expression was observed in other lines, suggesting that the differences in TP53 expression were not predominantly devoted to gemcitabine susceptibility. For instance, HupT-3 cells presented lower levels of TP53 but were sensitive, similar to MIA-PaCa-2 cells, whereas BxPC-3 cells with higher TP53 expression showed less sensitivity than MIA-PaCa-2 cells. Interestingly, SMAD4 was highly expressed in MIA PaCa-2, HupT-3 and PANC-1 cells, whereas little was tested in AsPC-1, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1 cells, implying that the expression might be potentially related to their susceptibility to gemcitabine. Although very significantly different levels of both TP53 and SMAD4 were observed in MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells (Fig.  1b ), the strongest expression of TP53 protein in MIA PaCa-2 cells might be attributed to the gain of function (GOF) mutant TP53 proteins and degradation of normally labile protein in MIA-paca-2 cells 31 . Subsequently, we detected the genetic status of these four drivers in eight cell lines (Table  1 ), and found that the  SMAD4  gene was mutated only in AsPC-1 (R100T mutation) and BxPC-3 (Del) cells. This matched the protein levels in these two lines, as well as the cellular resistance to gemcitabine. Therefore, according to the protein levels and genotypes of those four drivers between MIA PaCa-2/HupT-3 and AsPC-1/BxPC-3 cells, SMAD4 might be the predominant driver contributing to the gemcitabine response in PDAC.

As confirmed in Fig.  1c , SMAD4 protein was highly expressed in MIA PaCa-2 but not AsPC-1 cells. Specifically, the ratios of p-SMAD2/SMAD2, p-SMAD3/SMAD3, SMAD7, p-EGFR/EGFR and p-HER2/HER2 in AsPC-1 cells were obviously higher than those in MIA PaCa-2 cells, showing much more activated TGF-beta/SMADs signaling. Consequently, AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were chosen as in vitro models because of their resistant and sensitive responses to gemcitabine with deficient and sufficient SMAD4 expression, as well as mutant/wild-type genetic status, respectively, to further test the hypothesis that SMAD4 might play a key role in chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer. Simultaneously, we observed the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine and DTLL on the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines. As shown in Fig.  1d , AsPC-1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine than MIA PaCa-2 cells, or DTLL, which was mentioned in our previous study 17 .\nFurthermore, we downloaded the public data (TCGA-PAAD project) of pancreatic cancer patients from TCGA including clinical information on gemcitabine treatment and SMAD4 expression datasets to determine if SMAD4 expression in a PDAC patient is clinically correlated with gemcitabine response.", " By using the expression level of SMD4 as the criterion for predicting whether a patient is cured, we plotted an ROC curve with an AUC equal to 0.597 (Fig.  1e ). There were 35 patients with high SMAD4 expression, of which 17 (48.57%) samples had a positive drug response, whereas only 34.38% of patients (11 from 32 samples) with a low level of SMAD4 responded positively to gemcitabine. The odds ratio was 1.98 ( p  = 0.22), which indicated that the high level of SMAD4 expression facilitated the gemcitabine response clinically, although the significance level was more than 0.05 perhaps owing to the small sample size.\nTherefore, we demonstrated that SMAD4 was associated with not only PDAC occurrence and progression, but also the drug response to gemcitabine treatment both experimentally and clinically.\nDTLL potentiated the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on cell proliferation and cycle distribution\nTo investigate whether the combination of the two drugs could impact PDAC cell proliferation, we treated gemcitabine-resistant/SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 and gemcitabine-sensitive/SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 cells with gemcitabine, DTLL and both. The results from both MTS (Fig.  2a ) and CyQUANT (Fig.  2b ) assays indicated that the combination of gemcitabine with DTLL obviously inhibited AsPC-1 cell growth compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone. Compared with AsPC-1 cells, gemcitabine alone showed a stronger inhibitory effect in MIA PaCa-2 cells. The combination treatment revealed even more significant inhibition of cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The results in both lines showed that the combination treatment had synergistic effects evaluated by the combination index (CI) < 1 (the threshold line) for both (right panels in Fig.  2 a,  b ), indicating that DTLL effectively sensitized the cell response to gemcitabine. Fig. 2 DTLL potentiated proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest induced by gemcitabine. a  Effects on drug cytotoxicity in AsPC-1 and MIA-paca-2 cells after treatment with GEM, DTLL or both were detected by MTS assays. AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were exposed to a series of concentrations of GEM combined with 10 -10 , 10 -12  and 10 -13  mol/L DTLL for 72 h, respectively. The MTS assay was performed at the end of incubation. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with the GEM group, 'b',  p  < 0.05, compared with the 'GEM + DTLL'(10 -13 ) group, and'c',  p  < 0.05, compared with the 'GEM + DTLL'(10 -12 ) group.  b  The inhibitory effect of GEM and DTLL on cell proliferation in AsPC-1 and MIA-paca-2 cells was measured based on DNA fluorescence using the CyQUANT proliferation assay. The cells were exposed to a series of concentrations of GEM, DTLL or GEM combined with 10 -14  mol/L DTLL for 72 h, respectively. The assay utilizes a fluorescent dye to measure double strand DNA content with a microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission detection at 530 nm. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05, compared with the GEM group.  c  Synergistic effect of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, lapatinib and etoposide with DTLL (10 -12  mol/L) based on MTS assays. The synergistic effect of the combination treatment was evaluated by calculation of the combination index (CI) using the Chou-Talalay method. CI > 1, CI = 1 and CI < 1 indicate antagonistic, additive and synergistic effects, respectively. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3 biologically independent experiments). 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05, compared with the 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, lapatinib or etoposide group, respectively.  d  Cell cycle distribution in AsPC-1 and MIA paca-2 cells after treatment with GEM, DTLL or both was detected by flow cytometry assays. In the cell cycle assay, AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were treated with 0.02 \u00b5M gemcitabine, 0.", "1 nM DTLL or their combination for 24 h. The cell cycle distribution was evaluated using propidium iodide (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD for biologically triplicate experiments. Note :  One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used in  a . For  b ,  c , statistical significance was determined by using two-sided paired-samples  t -test. All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nTo further determine whether DTLL was capable of sensitizing cells to other drugs, we selected multiple antineoplastic agents widely used for pancreatic cancer treatment to detect the effect of DTLL combined with 5-fluorouracil (antimetabolite), oxaliplatin (DNA cross-linking), paclitaxel (anti-microtubule), irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor), etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor) and lapatinib (dual HER2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor), followed by evaluation of the synergistic effect by combination index (CI) calculation. The results (shown in Fig.  2c ) indicated that the combination of DTLL with all the above agents showed more significant antiproliferative effectiveness than either DTLL or those agents alone in both AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. The drug interactions of those agents and DTLL were shown to be synergistic with CIs <1 at those corresponding drug concentrations, except for each treated point of paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan or oxaliplatin. The plots in both AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells indicated that drugs at much higher doses showed less synergistic effects with CI values >1 (right panels in Fig.  2c ). These results suggest that DTLL can effectively sensitize PDAC cells to different types of drugs in addition to gemcitabine.\nSubsequently, we detected the cell cycle distribution in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells treated with PI staining. As shown in Fig.  2d , gemcitabine obviously induced the majority (73.54%) of MIA PaCa-2 cells to arrest at S phase compared to control cells at only 31.38% S phase arrest. However, slightly more AsPC-1 cells treated with gemcitabine arrested at both S (51.73% versus 41.50% in control) and G2/M (14.13% versus 4.26% in control), further suggesting that AsPC-1 cells were resistant to this drug. However, G2/M arrest in both lines was induced by DTLL. In the combined treatment group, G2/M arrest was observed in AsPC-1 cells, whereas an increase in S and G2/M phases of MIA PaCa-2 cells was detected.\nThe above results showed cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition at different levels between the two cell lines by treatments, suggesting the antiproliferative effects of the combination treatment on both lines.\nEffects of DTLL on different signaling pathways in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells\nAfter demonstrating the antiproliferative effects of the combination treatment, we characterized the potential mechanisms of action in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. To investigate inhibitory effects on PDAC cell proliferation and phases of drug treatments, we detected the expression of the apoptotic protein p-Bcl2, the DNA damage marker gammaH2AX and the cell cycle-related protein Cyclin D1. As shown in Fig.  3a , DTLL significantly decreased the expression of p-Bcl2 and Cyclin D1 with increased phosphorylated gammaH2AX in both AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Similar observations were obtained from alterations in those proteins after treatment with gemcitabine. Meanwhile, even more remarkable changes in both lines were observed when treated with both. The results further demonstrated that the combination treatment could eventually induce cellular apoptosis, cycle arrest, and DNA double-strand breaks in gemcitabine-resistant or gemcitabine-sensitive cells. Fig. 3 Functional characterization of gemcitabine, DTLL or combination therapy in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells.", " a ) and TGF-beta/SMADs signaling pathways ( b ) were determined by Western blot assays in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells after treatments with 2 \u00b5M gemcitabine, 0.1 nM DTLL and both at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h.

After treatment, the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions were detected using nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kits. Isolation of the cytosol and nuclei was analyzed by Western blot assay. beta-actin and Lamin B1 were used as the loading controls for the cytosol and nucleus, respectively. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments).

Cells were fixed and stained with anti-SMAD4 antibody. Following incubation with fluorescent secondary antibodies, the cells were stained with DAPI.

For  a - c , statistical significance was determined by using one - w a y ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. Source data are provided in the Source Data file. Protein levels of EGFR/HER2-dependent signaling pathways, PD-L1 signaling pathways, apoptotic protein Bcl2, DNA damage marker gammaH2AX, cell cycle-related protein Cyclin D1 (\nOur previous study demonstrated that DTLL enhanced DNA damage via EGFR/HER2-dependent blockage of the AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways in gemcitabine-sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells.", " Hence, to test if these cellular signaling pathways are involved, we treated gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 or gemcitabine-sensitive MIA PaCa-2 cells with vehicle, gemcitabine, DTLL or both for 4 h, and further analyzed the ratios of active phosphorylated and total proteins for HER-2, EGFR, ERK1/2, AKT, mTOR, and PD-L1. Interestingly, the responses in the AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways were quite different between AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. After treatment with DTLL or both in MIA PaCa-2 cells, the ratios of active phosphorylated and total EGFR, HER-2, AKT and mTOR proteins were obviously decreased (Fig.  3a ). Furthermore, there were significant decreases in PD-L1 expression, which confirmed our previous findings regarding to DTLL function 25  and suggested similar AKT/mTOR signaling affected by its combination treatment in MIA PaCa-2 cells. In contrast, the ratios of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-HER-2/HER-2, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR were significantly increased in AsPC-1 cells. Furthermore, an apparent increase in PD-L1 expression was observed in AsPC-1 cells, indicating that there were obviously different molecular mechanisms by which these two cells differed in drug response to the combination therapy. In addition, no changes in ERK1/2 expression in either of the two cell lines were found.\nWe further explored whether other molecular signaling pathways were triggered by the combination treatment in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Total differences in TGF-beta/SMADs signaling proteins were observed between those two lines, including SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4, SMAD7, and TGF-beta levels. The data shown in Fig.  3b  indicated that treatment with DTLL alone or in combination with gemcitabine induced the expression of SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 in SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 cells, while a marked decrease in SMAD7 expression was observed. This result indicated that, unlike MIA PaCa-2 cells, DTLL might restore SMAD4 expression by inhibiting SMAD7 in AsPC-1 cells, leading to significant reactivation of SMAD4-dependent signaling. In contrast, DTLL alone or in combination with gemcitabine significantly decreased the expression of SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 in SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 cells, but they markedly increased the expression of SMAD7. We speculated that immediate activation of inhibitory SMADs (SMAD7) in MIA PaCa-2 cells might form a complex with SMAD2/3, thereby interfering with the complex formation between SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 32 , and preventing further signal propagation. Therefore, the above results demonstrated that the combination treatment had opposite effects on the TGF-beta/SMADs signaling pathways of PDAC cells in a SMAD4-dependent manner.\nSubsequently, we detected differences in the effects of DTLL on the translocation of SMAD4 induced from the cytosol to the nucleus in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins of AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were extracted after treatments to detect the distribution of SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 in parallel Western blot assays (Fig.  3c ). The results showed that the phosphorylated forms of SMAD2/SMAD3 and SMAD4 were significantly increased in the nucleus of AsPC-1 cells treated with either DTLL or both, but decreased in the cytoplasm. However, there were significant decreases in the ratios of p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and p-SMAD3/SMAD3, as well as decreased SMAD4 in the nucleus of MIA PaCa-2 cells after treatment with DTLL or both. In the MIA PaCa-2 cytoplasm, we found an increase in SMAD4 and enhanced ratios of p-SMAD2/SMAD2 and p-SMAD3/SMAD3 in cells treated by DTLL or both. As the results from the immunofluorescence assay show in Fig.  3d , the combination treatment, similar to DTLL, significantly increased the nuclear accumulation of SMAD4 in AsPC-1 cells, but suppressed its accumulation in the MIA PaCa-2 nucleus. We demonstrated that the SMAD-dependent signaling pathway was reactivated by DTLL or combination therapy, contributing to increases in the inhibition of SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 cell gr", "owth. However, similar drug responses but controversial alterations in this pathway were observed in SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 cells.\nDownregulation or upregulation of SMAD4 altered PDAC susceptibility to gemcitabine\nSince we have found a relationship between the gemcitabine response and SMAD4 protein levels, we altered SMAD4 expression by transiently transfecting either a specific siRNA or overexpression vector of SMAD4 into pancreatic cancer cells to detect the effect of SMAD4 expression levels on PDAC cellular susceptibility to gemcitabine. As shown in Fig.  4a , downregulation of SMAD4 at both mRNA and protein levels in MIA PaCa-2 cells that carry the wild-type  SMAD4  gene with high protein levels significantly reduced cell sensitivity to gemcitabine after exposure to various concentrations for 72 h. In contrast, SMAD4 overexpression apparently sensitized AsPC-1 cells carrying the R100T mutation with little SMAD4 protein expression to gemcitabine (Fig.  4b ). The results indicated that SMAD4 contributed to the cellular response to gemcitabine in PDAC cells. However, it might be involved in distinct action mechanisms owing to different genotypes and protein levels of SMAD4 in MIA PaCa-2 versus AsPC-1 cells. Fig. 4 Downregulation or upregulation of SMAD4 altered PDAC susceptibility to gemcitabine. a  Downregulation of SMAD4 reduced the sensitivity of MIA PaCa-2 cells to gemcitabine. After knocking down SMAD4 with its specific siRNAs, the mRNA and protein levels of  SMAD4  were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. MIA PaCa-2 cells were exposed to various concentrations of GEM for 72 h and cell viability was measured by MTS assay. The results were obtained from three independent experiments. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). A pooled siRNA against SMAD4 (siSMAD4) and a scramble siRNA (siNC) indicate siRNA targeting SMAD4 and its negative control, respectively.

After SMAD4 was upregulated by its overexpression vector, the mRNA and protein levels of  SMAD4  in AsPC-1 cells were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. The AsPC-1 cell line was exposed to various concentrations of GEM for 72 h, and cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. The results were obtained from three independent experiments. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent experiments). pSMAD4 and pEV indicate SMAD4 overexpression plasmid and its empty vector, respectively.

When treated with DTLL,  p  < 0.001 for all time points except for 0, 0.25 and 0.", "5 h; When treated with CHX + DTLL,  p  < 0.001 for 1, 24, 36, and 48 h. Note: All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. For  a ,  b ,  e , statistical significance was determined by using two-sided Paired-samples t - test. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used in  c . Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nDifferences in the protein degradation of wild-type and mutant SMAD4 in PDAC cells and DTLL impact\nTo further test if the effect of SMAD4 genetic status on its expression, we performed qRT-PCR and Western blot assays to detect differences in  SMAD4  mRNA expression among BxPC-3 (deleted  SMAD4 ), MIA PaCa-2 (wild-type  SMAD4 ) and AsPC-1 (R100T mutant  SMAD4 ) cells, as well as that in protein degradation.  SMAD4  mRNA and protein expression was not detectable in BxPC-3 cells, consistent with its genetic status. With obviously higher levels of  SMAD4  mRNA in MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells, there was no significant difference between those two lines (left panel in Fig.  4c ). However, SMAD4 protein expression in MIA PaCa-2 cells was much higher than that in AsPC-1 cells (right panel in Fig.  4c ). The above result implied that SMAD4 genetic status is responsible for SMAD4 protein levels.\nFurthermore, mutant SMAD4 protein in AsPC-1 cells had much shorter half-life of only approximately one hour, showing rapid protein degradation after 24 h of treatment with cycloheximide (CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor), compared to the prolonged wild-type protein in MIA PaCa-2 cells even after 72 h of CHX treatment (Fig.  4d ). Interestingly, with the induction of DTLL, mutant protein degradation of SMAD4 in AsPC-1 cells was significantly retarded, with a dramatic 9-fold-increase in its protein level even after 48 h of CHX treatment compared to the control at the beginning time point. The wild-type SMAD4 protein in MIA PaCa-2 cells also showed a slight increase with the induction of DTLL (Fig.  4e ). In addition, SMAD4 protein degradation was not observed and induced by DTLL in BxPC-3 cells (Fig.  4 d,  e ). This suggests that DTLL might significantly enhance the expression level of SMAD4, especially in SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 cells, and thus resensitize the cellular response to gemcitabine or other chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, BxPC-3 cells without SMAD4 mRNA and protein expression were suitable for creating wild-type and mutant SMAD4 overexpression vectors in follow-up studies.\nEvaluation of in vivo efficacy in CDX models from AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells\nNext, we determined whether there was a difference in the effect of SMAD4 between wild-type and mutant proteins on gemcitabine efficacy in vivo, and how DTLL or its combinational therapy influenced the growth of tumors expressing these two different SMAD4. The above two AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 lines, serving as SMAD4-mutant/deficient and SMAD4-wild-type/sufficient PDAC cells, were used to generate in vivo CDX mouse models for evaluation of the antineoplastic efficacy of vehicle, gemcitabine or DTLL alone, and the combination. As shown in Fig. S 1 a, AsPC-1 xenografts had much higher expression of p-EGFR and p-SMAD2/SMAD2, p-SMAD3/SMAD3, SMAD7 but lack of SMAD4 and TGF-beta expression, as compared to the MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model, further confirming the results from the in vitro observations.\nIn the AsPC-1 xenograft model (shown in Fig.  5a  and Supplementary Table  1 ), gemcitabine had a minimal inhibitory effect at 26.05% and DTLL slightly repressed tumor growth by 39.80%. However, the combination of gemcitabine and DTLL had remarkable synergistic efficacy with a significant tumor inhibition rate of 66.96% in the AsPC-1 xenograft model. As shown in Fig.  5b  and Supplementary Table  1 , tumor growth of MIA PaCa-2 CDX models was obviously inhibited in all treatment groups compared with the control.", " Specifically, gemcitabine or DTLL alone was able to apparently inhibit tumor growth of MIA PaCa-2 models by 59.04% or 79.62%, respectively. The combination treatment significantly repressed tumor growth by 88.15%. In addition, no deaths or significant changes in body weight were observed (Fig. S 2 a and S 2b ) in treated mice, and no toxic-pathological organs were observed (Fig. S 3 a and S 3b ) as compared to the control group. Fig. 5 Evaluation of in vivo efficacy by cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models of human pancreatic cancer. a ) and MIA PaCa-2 ( b ). In both CDX models, the mice received an equal volume of physiological saline (control group), 60 mg/kg gemcitabine intraperitoneally administered once a week (GEM group), 0.05 mg/kg DTLL at the LDM-equivalent dose intravenously administered (DTLL group) every ten days, and the same dosing administration for either DTLL or gemcitabine (GEM + DTLL group). Tumor volume in each group was measured and calculated for comparison between 'GEM + DTLL'versus other groups. Data are representative of biologically independent replicates as the mean \u00b1 SEM ( n  = 6 for AsPC-1 and  n  = 5 for MIA PaCa-2 tumors). In AsPC-1 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23;  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus GEM) for day 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23. In MIA PaCa-2 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 9, 12, 19, and 22.  c  Protein expression levels in tumor tissue samples from either AsPC-1 or MIA PaCa-2 models after treatment with GEM, DTLL or both were determined by Western blot assay. Band intensities were quantified using Image J. Data are displayed as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 3 biologically independent replicates). In AsPC-1 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 for SMAD4 between 'GEM + DTLL' versus Control, 'GEM + DTLL' versus GEM or DTLL versus GEM groups;  p  < 0.001 for p-Akt/Akt between DTLL versus Control groups. In MIA PaCa-2 CDX model,  p  < 0.001 for SMAD7 between DTLL versus Control groups.  d  IHC staining of Ki-67 in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 xenograft models (\u00d7100). Tumor sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and incubated with Ki-67 antibody, followed by incubation with secondary antibody. The results were observed by an inverted microscope using DAB as a chromogenic reagent. Images are representative of three biologically independent replicates with a scale bar representing 50 \u03bcm ( n  = 3). In either AsPC-1 or MIA PaCa-2 tumors,  p  < 0.001 between 'GEM + DTLL '  versus Control, as well as DTLL versus GEM. In AsPC-1 tumors,  p  < 0.001 between GEM versus Control groups.  e  Apoptotic cells in the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 models were measured in TUNEL assay (\u00d7200 ) . Apoptotic cells in tumor tissue were determined by the TUNEL method according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope. Red fluorescence represents the positive cells. Images are representative of three biologically independent replicates with a scale bar indicating 25 \u03bcm ( n  = 3). In both AsPC-1 tumors and MIA PaCa-2 tumors,  p  < 0.001 when compared 'GEM + DTLL'versus all three Control, GEM and DTLL groups. In MIA PaCa-2 tumors,  p  < 0.001 (DTLL versus Control, or GEM versus Control). Note: For  a - e , 'a' indicates  p  < 0.05 as compared with the control, 'b',  p  < 0.05 compared with the GEM group and 'c',  p  < 0.05 compared with the DTLL group.

For  a-e , statistical significance was determined by using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. Source data are provided in the Source Data fil e .", " Inhibitory effect on tumor growth of cells treated with gemcitabine, DTLL and both by using two CDX models of AsPC-1 (\nAfter mice were sacrificed, we further detected any alterations in the protein expression of tumor tissue samples in Western blot assays to confirm our results from the above in vitro functional studies, and thereby shed light on its therapeutic efficacy. For SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 tumor models, the ratios of p-EGFR/EGFR, p-HER-2/HER-2, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR as well as PD-L1 expression were more effectively inhibited after treatment with DTLL or both than in gemcitabine or control-treated groups, whereas slightly decreased SMAD4 and dramatically increased SMAD7 were observed. These data implied that combination treatment enhanced antineoplastic efficacy via EGFR/HER2-dependent blockade of AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways in MIA PaCa-2 xenografts, consistent with the above in vitro results as well as our previous findings of DTLL 25 . In contrast, in either DTLL or the combination treatment group of SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 models (shown in Fig.  5c ), significantly increased expression of SMAD2/SMAD3 and SMAD4, as well as decreased SMAD7 were tested when compared to the control or gemcitabine, suggesting that DTLL combined with gemcitabine could obviously reactivate SMAD4, and thereby inhibit AsPC-1 tumor growth in a SMAD-dependent manner. Moreover, we detected significant increases in the ratios of active phosphorylated and total proteins for EGFR, HER-2, AKT, and PD-L1, as well as little alteration in p-mTOR/mTOR with gemcitabine or the combination treatment. In contrast to the effect on SMAD4-sufficient MIA PaCa-2 tumors, DTLL inhibited the growth of SMAD4-deficient AsPC-1 tumors but not by blocking the EGFR/AKT/mTOR and PD-L1 signaling pathways.\nIHC staining of Ki-67 with semiquantification displayed a remarkable antiproliferative effect on tumor cells in the combination treatment group when compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone (Fig.  5d ), as well as greater apoptosis in the TUNEL assay (Fig.  5e ). Our results suggested that the combination treatment showed highly potent efficacy by using in vivo CDX models compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone.\nEvaluation of in vivo efficacy by PDX models of human pancreatic cancer\nPDX models derived from fresh human tumor tissue have been widely used to evaluate the pharmacological efficacy of various therapeutic agents and to predict their clinical implementation in the future as an effective study tool for translational medicine 33 . Therefore, to further investigate the antitumor effects of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine, we selected two PDX models (PA1233 and PA3142) as SMAD4-mutant/deficient and SMAD4-wild-type/sufficient models, based on SMAD4 genetic status obtained from available RNA sequencing datasets ( https://models.crownbio.com/pancreatic-cancer/ ) and protein levels by using Western blot assays (Fig. S 1b ). Similar to the profiles of AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 tumors (Table  1 , Fig.S 1a ), the  SMAD4  gene in PA1233 tumors was mutated (D537Y and E171D) with obviously lower protein levels whereas higher expression was shown in PA3142 due to the wild-type  SMAD4 . Moreover, higher expression levels of EGFR and HER2 were detected in PA3142 models than in PA1233. These two PDX models had previously shown different responses to gemcitabine validated from the report of the company where PA1233 tumors were resistant to gemcitabine with a very slower growth rate and PA3142 models were sensitive with tumors rapidly developed ( https://models.crownbio.com/pancreatic-cancer/ ). As shown in Supplementary Table  1 , the results from the in vivo evaluation of efficacy in PA1233 models indicated that the inhibitory rate of tumor volume on day 28 at the end of the experiment was only 11.65% and 31.54% for gemcitabine and DTLL alone, respectively. However, the combination therapy obviously improved the antineoplastic effect with a 72.25% inhibition rate.", " As observed in Fig.  6a , in the SMAD4-deficient PA1233 model with the combination treatment, there were significantly superior antineoplastic effects achieved when compared with the gemcitabine or DTLL alone group. In the SMAD4-sufficient PA3142 models, the inhibitory rates of gemcitabine and DTLL were 54.37% and 50.50%, respectively. The combination treatment significantly repressed tumors at 77.17% (Fig.  6b ). The results showed that the combination treatment exhibited highly potent efficacy in both SMAD4-mutant/deficient and SMAD4-wild-type/sufficient PDX models compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone. Fig. 6 Evaluation of in vivo efficacy by patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human pancreatic cancer. a ) and PA3142 ( b ) on tumor growth. In both PDX models, the mice were received equal volumes of physiological saline (control group), 60 mg/kg gemcitabine every four days (GEM group), 0.05 mg/kg DTLL once a week (DTLL group) and 60 mg/kg gemcitabine combined with 0.025 mg/kg DTLL (GEM + DTLL group). Data are representative of biologically independent replicates as the mean \u00b1 SEM ( n  = 3 for PA1233 and  n  = 4 for PA3142 tumors).

Source data are provided in the Source Data file.", " Inhibitory effect of gemcitabine, DTLL and both in two PDX models of PA1233 (\nSubsequently, we investigated the drug effects on the expression of relevant proteins in the AKT/mTOR and TGFbeta/SMADs signaling pathways in the two PDX models. Similar results were observed (Fig.  6c ), in which the combination treatment exhibited similar inhibitory trends in the ratios of p-EGFR/EGFR and pHER2/HER2 in both models. However, the combination significantly upregulated the protein levels of SMAD4 and PD-L1 in PA1233 tumors and downregulated these two proteins in PA3142 models (Fig.  6c ). In addition, there were no obvious effects on the p-mTOR/mTOR ratios detected in the PA1233 tumors whereas significantly decreased ratios of p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR were observed in PA3142 tumors treated with DTLL and both. Tumor specimens were tested for IHC staining of Ki-67 and apoptosis in the TUNEL assay with semiquantification (Fig.  6 d,  e ). Similar results were observed with significantly downregulated Ki-67 but increased apoptosis in the combination treatment group as compared to the gemcitabine or DTLL alone group. The above results further demonstrated that the combination treatment showed high inhibitory efficacy with distinct alterations in cell signaling pathways in a SMAD4-dependent manner.\nEvaluation of gemcitabine efficacy in BxPC-3 cells with stably expressing wild-type and mutant SMAD4 in vitro and in vivo\nAs we mentioned above, BxPC-3 cells do not express SMAD4 mRNA or protein of owing to gene deletion. Therefore, we used this cell line to generate three types of stably transfected cells containing empty control, mutant, and wild-type SMAD4 overexpression vectors after creating the mutant SMAD4 overexpression vector via site-mutagenesis assay (Fig.  7a ) to further test the different effects of wild-type and mutant SMAD4 on drug efficacy. There was no apparent difference in the mRNA level of  SMAD4  in BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cells, while there was a much lower level of mutant protein than wild-type one, as detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays (Fig.  7b ,  c ).

Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM for biologically independent replicates as the mean \u00b1 SD ( n  = 5). In BxPC3-EV CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 27, 30 and 33. In BxPC3-WT CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus Control) for day 21, 24, 27, 30, and 33. In BxPC3- Mut CDX model,  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL' versus Control) for day 24, 27, 30, and 33;  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL' versus GEM) for day 27, 30, and 33;  p  < 0.001 ('GEM + DTLL'versus DTLL) for day 30. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used in  b ,  d ,  h ; Paired-samples  t -test was two-sided and used in  e  and  f . All specific  p  values are presented in the Source Data file and only significant values are shown in figures. Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\nWe further evaluated the in vitro inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on the growth of BxPC-3 cells with empty vector (BxPC3-EV), wild-type (BxPC3-WT) and mutant (BxPC3-Mut) overexpression vectors. As shown in Fig.  7d , BxPC3-WT cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine than BxPC3 mock or BxPC3-EV cells, but BxPC3-Mut cells showed little difference from those two. Gemcitabine or DTLL alone, and their combination were tested for proliferative inhibition of BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut cells by using MTS and CyQUANT assays (Fig.  7e ,  f ), respectively. The results indicated that the combination of gemcitabine with DTLL showed the most significant inhibition rate of tumor cell growth when compared to gemcitabine or DTLL alone, obviously showing a synergistic effect evaluated by CI calculation, not a simple additive effect. In addition, the results from the cytometry assay (Fig.  7g ) showed that more G1/S arrest was observed in BxPC3-WT cells treated with gemcitabine than in the other two types of cells, partly explaining the sensitivity of BxPC3-WT cells overexpressing SMAD4 to gemcitabine.", " However, DTLL or its combination therapy significantly induced an increase in G2/M cells in both BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut lines. This further confirmed that DTLL potentiated the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on cell proliferation and cycle distribution.\nNext, we used the above BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT, and BxPC3-Mut stably transfected cell lines to generate in vivo CDX mouse models for evaluation of antineoplastic efficacy of vehicle, gemcitabine or DTLL alone, and the combination. As shown in Fig.  7h  and Supplementary Table  2 , gemcitabine had a minimal inhibitory effect on BxPC3-Mut tumors at 7.46% and DTLL slightly repressed tumor growth by 47.61%, however, the combination of gemcitabine and DTLL had remarkable synergistic efficacy with a tumor inhibition rate of 78.62% in this gemcitabine-resistant xenograft model. In the BxPC3-WT models, gemcitabine or DTLL alone was able to apparently inhibit tumor growth by 65.33% or 59.19%, respectively, suggesting its sensitivity to both drugs. The combination treatment significantly repressed tumor growth by 82.06%. In addition, there were no deaths or significant changes in body weight observed in treated mice (Fig. S 2c ), as well as no toxic-pathological organs (Fig. S 3c ), compared to the control group. This further confirmed the synergistic inhibitory effect of DTLL in combination with gemcitabine on in vivo tumor growth, similar to the above results obtained in both CDX and PDX models.\nAll the above results demonstrated that different SMAD4 genetic statuses in PDAC cells are responsible for distinct protein levels between mutant and wild-type SMAD4. Expression has been proven to affect cellular susceptibility to gemcitabine by using ex/in vivo MIA PaCa-2, AsPC-1, and BxPC-3 cell lines or CDX/PDX mouse models with either mutant or wild-type SMAD4 expression. We confirmed that DTLL sensitizes gemcitabine efficacy in those models, and further conducted functional characterization in follow-up studies with the above BxPC3-EV, BxPC3-WT. and BxPC3-Mut stably transfected cell lines.\nDistinct protein levels and half-life times of mutant and wild-type SMAD4 with/without DTLL induction in BxPC-3 cells\nThere was no apparent difference in  SMAD4  mRNA levels between AsPC-1 vs. MIA PaCa-2 (left panel in Fig.  4c ) and BxPC3-Mut vs. BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  7b ), indicating no impact on  SMAD4  mRNA transcription affected by the R100T mutation. Therefore, we tested whether there was a difference in protein degradation between mutant and wild-type SMAD4 in BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut stably transfected cell lines by Western blot assays, followed with DTLL treatment. The results demonstrated that the mutant SMAD4 protein was degraded rapidly (Fig.  8a ) but dramatically induced by DTLL (Fig.  8b ) in BxPC3-Mut cells, whereas wild-type SMAD4 remained much longer and showed a slight increase via DTLL treatment in BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8 a,  b ), consistent with the results from the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 lines (Fig.  4 d,  e ). TRIM33 protein, as a specific E3 ligase for SMAD4 ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation, was steeply decreased in BxPC3-WT cells after being treated with DTLL from 0, 0.25 till 8 h. However, its level maintained even for 24 h if given DTLL induction and gradually started to decrease in BxPC3-Mut cells (Fig.  8b ), which in part explained why the degradation velocity of mutant SMAD4 was significantly retarded if given DTLL induction. Next, we tested the protein levels of SMAD4 after cotreatment with CHX to exclude the influence of DTLL induction on protein synthesis and further demonstrated more significant induction of SMAD4 via DTLL in BxPC3-Mut cells than in BxPC3-WT cells (Fig.  8c ). This result confirmed that SMAD4 genetic status is responsible for SMAD4 protein expression and that the difference in TRIM33 mediated proteasome degradation between mutant and wild-type proteins partially contributed to their distinguished protein levels.", " Moreover, DTLL significantly prolonged the half-life time by inhibiting SMAD4 degradation but impacted wild-type and mutant proteins to different degrees, thereby reactivating SMAD4 function with restored proteins, especially in BxPC3-Mut cells, consequently leading to enhanced cellular susceptibility to gemcitabine.

As shown in Fig.  8d , both the BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut lines had decreased expression of p-EGFR, EGFR, p-HER2, and HER2. Similar to the observation in AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, significant decreases in p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR expression were observed in BxPC3-WT cells, while an increase in p-AKT/AKT was detected in BxPC3-Mut cells. However, there was significantly induced expression of SMAD4, p-SMAD2/SMAD2, p-SMAD3/SMAD3, and TGF-beta, but an apparent decrease in SMAD7 in the BxPC3-Mut lines compared to the BxPC3-WT lines (Fig.  8d ), further confirming the results from the observations in the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 lines (Fig.  3 a,  b ).", "\nNext, we tested changes in cell cycle relevant proteins to determine if DTLL affected the expression level of any protein mediated by SMAD4. With DTLL or its combination treatment, the expression levels of cyclin D3, cyclin B1, CDK2, phos-CDC2, phos-Wee1, and P27 were reduced in both the BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT lines (Fig.  8e ). However, significantly increased expression of P21, cyclin E2 and CDK4 in the BxPC3-Mut line was observed, while decreases in those proteins were detected in the BxPC3-WT line (Fig.  8e ).\nInterestingly, we found that the expression levels of phospho-P65, P65, and P50 units of NF-\u03baB, a well-known transcription factor, were induced significantly by DTLL or its combination in the BxPC3-Mut line. Along with increased mutant SMAD4 by DTLL induction, apoptotic proteins including BAX, FADD, and cleaved caspase-8 were significantly induced, while anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and MCL1 proteins were reduced (Fig.  8f ). Moreover, the semiquantification results in BxPC3-Mut cells demonstrated that there were significant decreases in the ratio of Bcl-2/BAX and MCL1/BAX after treatment with DTLL or its combination compared to the control, indicating the consequence of enhanced cell apoptosis by DTLL. On the other hand, in the BxPC3-WT line, all the above proteins were apparently reduced with decreased SMAD4, except for induced cleaved caspase-8 (Fig.  8f ). The results from semiquantification in the BxPC3-WT line also demonstrated the consequence of cell apoptosis with significant decreases in the ratio of Bcl-2/BAX and MCL1/BAX after treated by DTLL or its combination compared to the control. The directions of the changes in SMAD4 and NF-\u03baB expression induced by DTLL, as well as the expression of their targeted apoptotic/anti-apoptotic proteins, were opposite between the BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut lines, but eventually led to the consequence of enhanced cell apoptosis and sensitized drug response.\nMoreover, to determine if the expression of apoptotic (BAX, FADD) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and MCL1) proteins was transcriptionally regulated by NF-\u03baB mediated via either mutant or wild-type SMAD4, we tested their mRNA levels in the same cell samples by qRT-PCR. Indeed, the mRNA levels of P50, P65, BAX, and FADD as SMAD4 targets were obviously upregulated along with the same increasing tendency at the  SMAD4  mRNA level in BxPC3-Mut cells when treated with DTLL or the combination, as compared to the control or gemcitabine-treated cells, implying that SMAD4 directly promoted its downstream target NF-\u03baB which further regulated BAX and FADD expression as a regulatory transcription. However, slight decreases in Bcl-2 and MCL1 expression were detected in DTLL-treated cells, independent of NF-\u03baB regulation promoted by SMAD4. On the other hand, along with little change in  SMAD4  mRNA expression in BxPC3-WT cells treated with DTLL or the combination, the mRNA levels of P50, BAX, Bcl-2, and MCL1 were significantly lower than those in the control or gemcitabine-treated cells, (Fig.  8g ). The results suggested that, in BxPC3-WT cells, decreased NF-\u03baB was upstream of BAX, Bcl-2, and MCL1 but not transcriptionally regulated by SMAD4, and DTLL altered NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity but did not affect its expression through SMAD4.\nThese alterations in the mRNA levels of these two lines were largely consistent with the above results from the Western blot assay (Fig.  8f ). In addition, all of the above relevant proteins were detected for validating their basic expression profiles in the BxPC3-EV, -WT and -Mut cells (Fig. S 4 ).\nDifferent protein interactions of mutant or wild-type SMAD4 with/without DTLL induction in BxPC-3 cells\nThe results from the co-IP assay further indicated that both mutant and wild-type SMAD4 proteins were able to interact with P50 and P65 (Fig.  8h ), which implied that SMAD4 might impact on the transcriptional bioactivity of NF-\u03baB, which was further responsible for regulating the expression of the above mRNAs and prot", "eins in both BxPC3-WT and BxPC3-Mut cells. Moreover, the interactions of wild-type SMAD4 with P50 and P65 were significantly inhibited in BxPC3-WT cells after treated by DTLL but were apparently increased in DTLL-treated BxPC3-Mut cells (Fig.  8i ). This might explain the reason for the difference intendancies in the downstream gene expression affected by NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity between those two cell lines after treated by DTLL. Owing to the increased bioactivity of mutant SMAD4-mediated NF-\u03baB given DTLL, apoptotic BAX and FADD proteins were significantly induced and resulted in cell death (increased cleaved caspase-8). However, the transcriptional bioactivity of NF-\u03baB promoted by wild-type SMAD4 was inhibited by DTLL, and thus anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and MCL1) were downregulated, mainly responsible for the increase in programmed cell death (enhanced cleaved caspase-8).\nIn accordance with the results of TRIM33 alteration over the time course shown in Fig.  8b , the mRNA and protein levels of TRIM33 in BxPC3-Mut cells were decreased but not as significantly as those in BxPC3-WT cells after treatment with DTLL for 24 h (Fig.  8 f,  g ). This result suggested that TRIM33 was not regulated by SMAD4, and seemed to be the feedback of either mutant or wild-type SMAD4 expression. We also demonstrated the interaction of TRIM33 with either mutant or wild-type SMAD4 proteins (Fig.  8h ). The interaction between wild-type SMAD4 and TRIM33 was significantly inhibited in BxPC3-WT cells after treatment with DTLL, while their interaction was apparently increased in DTLL-treated BxPC3-Mut cells (Fig.  8i ). Different levels of TRIM33 expression in both cell lines were decreased but to different degrees. Therefore, we speculated that, in BxPC3-WT cells with high levels of wild-type SMAD4 expression, TRIM33 was responsible for its degradation to a certain degree and interacted with SMAD4 to maintain its expression balance. If given DTLL or its combination treatment, TRIM33 was reduced rapidly within 8 h with its apparently impaired interaction with wild-type SMAD4 to retard its degradation and maintain its expression balance. However, little expression of mutant SMAD4 in BxPC3-Mut cells was accompanied by a low level of TRIM33 which mediates its proteasome degradation. With DTLL or its combination treatments, TRIM33 was decreased at slower and lower velocities, thus resulting in very slow degradation of mutant SMAD4 and increased accumulation of SMAD4 protein expression. Consequently, the increased accumulation of mutant SMAD4 expression is accompanied by its significantly enhanced interaction with TRIM33 by DTLL to compensate for its degradation for a balance.\nDifferent proteomic and gemcitabine pharmacokinetic profiles in mutant and wild-type SMAD4 cells with/without DTLL induction in BxPC-3 cells\nIn addition, we further performed a proteomic study to determine if SMAD4 has effects on the expression of gemcitabine-relevant transporters or pharmacokinetic enzymes. All the proteomic raw data and the results files have been uploaded to the iProX Consortium ( https://www.iprox.org/ ) with PXD identifiers (PXD031977). As shown in the heatmap (left panel of Fig.  8j ) and Supplementary Data  3 , the proteomic profiles of BxPC3-Mut and -WT cells without any treatments were quite distinct and showed fewer changes after gemcitabine treated both lines, respectively. DTLL or its combination obviously altered the profile of BxPC3-Mut cells compared to the control or gemcitabine-induced profile, unlike BxPC3-WT cells. Next, we found a total of 12 proteins of gemcitabine-relevant transporters or pharmacokinetic enzymes detectable (Supplementary Table  3 ), including ABCC1, CDA, CDC5L, CMPK1, DCK, DCTD, NT5C, NT5C2, NT5C3A, RRM1, RRM2, and SLC29A1. Except for DCK, DCTD, NT5C2 and NT5C3A, all the other nine proteins were significantly altered, as shown in the expression heatmap (right panel of Fig.", "  8j ) between BxPC3-Mut versus BxPC3-WT cells after treatments. The expression of SMAD4 was included as a positive control, which confirmed that SMAD4 expression alterations (Ratio  Mut/WT  = 0.017,  p  = 7.3 \u00d7 10 -5 ), similar to the results in Western blot assay. Specifically, the expression of RRM2 was much lower in BxPC3-Mut cells than in BxPC3-WT cells (Ratio  Mut/WT  = 0.22,  p  = 2.24 \u00d7 10 -6 ), and was significantly induced after treated with DTLL and its combination, with a similar altered trend of SMAD4 in those cells. The proteomic results implied that SMAD4 status significantly impacted the proteomic profiles as a result of chemoresistance properties that DTLL might also affect the proteomic profiles of both lines, and that it altered cellular susceptibility via RRM2 induction regulated by SMAD4 in BxPC3-Mut cells.\nAll the above results suggested different action mechanisms of DTLL enhancing cellular susceptibility on the basis of SMAD4 genetic or expression status in BxPC3-Mut and BxPC3-WT cells, respectively, thereby shedding light on its synergistic therapeutic efficacy.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "9489697_Introduction", "text": ["\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death and is the most aggressive cancer with a five-year survival of <5% 1 , 2 . Gemcitabine is the first-line treatment for PDAC 3  but offers little therapeutic value because chemoresistance develops rapidly and PDAC has profound symptomatic effects 4 . Moreover, the newly developed PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies even showed a poor effect on pancreatic cancer 5 . Therefore, additional therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer are urgently needed.\nTypical genetic alterations observed in PDAC include activation of the oncogene KRAS (>90%), inactivation or loss of tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A (95%), TP53 (50-75%), SMAD4 (~55%), PTEN (~60%) and mutation of the DNA repair gene BRCA2 (7-19%), contributing to tumor progression or relapse 6 - 9 . Unfortunately, few of these drivers are currently druggable, thus making it difficult to devise effective therapies against PDAC. Increasingly, molecular profiling of tumor specimens is being utilized to reveal tumor susceptibilities and accelerate the development of precision medicine. A personalized therapeutic approach targeting key drivers associated with PDAC is likely to be a future trend. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that these four tumor drivers play roles in gemcitabine susceptibility to pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells 10 - 13 . A recent study showed that a therapeutic antibody targeting KRAS synergistically increased the antitumor activity of gemcitabine by inhibiting RAS downstream signaling in pancreatic cancer with KRAS mutation 10 . The loss or mutation of TP53 promoted gemcitabine resistance in PDAC 11 , 12 . P16/CDKN2A inactivated pancreatic cancer cells are 3-4 fold less sensitive to gemcitabine 13 . DPC4/SMAD4 inactivation was modestly less sensitive to gemcitabine 13 . A previous study using mouse models suggested that co-deletion of PTEN and SMAD4 contributes to and mediates resistance to pancreatic cancer 14 . In addition, SMAD4 loss in pancreatic cancer causes alterations to multiple kinase pathways (particularly the phosphorylated ERK/p38/Akt pathways), and increases chemoresistance in vitro 15 . Furthermore, PDAC cells with intact SMAD4 are more sensitive to TGF-beta1 inhibitor treatment to reduce cell migration, whereas PDAC cells lacking SMAD4 showed decreased cell motility in response to EGFR inhibitor treatment in PDAC carcinoma tissue 16 , 17 . Those evidences support that it is necessary and convincing to develop more treatment strategies for PDAC carrying fatal mutations in driver genes.\nAntibody-based or ligand-based molecularly targeted drugs including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and fusion proteins have recently become effective drug delivery systems 18 . To date, several EGFR-targeted therapies are available for PDAC treatment 19 - 23 . In our previous study, DTLL (named as a dual-targeting ligand-based lidamycin) was shown to be a highly potent bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-like agent consisting of two oligopeptides against EGFR and HER2, and an enediyne antibiotics lidamycin (LDM) 16 . It was designed not only to inhibit the activities of both EGFR and HER2, but also to combine with the cytotoxic effect of LDM. Our previous studies demonstrated that DTLL was superior to free LDM alone in ovarian carcinoma 24 , PDAC 25 , and esophageal cancer 26 . Furthermore, DTLL might suppress pancreatic tumor progression by EGFR/HER2-dependent blockage of AKT/mTOR-signaling and PD-L1/PD1-mediated escape from immunosurveillance in PDAC 25 .\nWe previously found that human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells with high EGFR/HER2 expression showed the strongest binding affinity to DTLP, the precursor of DTLL, however, the AsPC-1 cell line or xenograft tumor showed intermediate resistance to DTLL, whereas MIA PaCa-2 had stronger affinity and better response 25 . This raised an interesting proposal and encouraged us to explore more effective strategies and underlie relevant mechanisms especially for drug-resistant pancreatic cancers. Other studies have also found the emergence of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in PDAC 27 , 28 . To overcome that, several combination strategies of either targeted agents or checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapies showed synergistic activities, highlighting the potential of these strategies for pancreatic cancer 29 . For instance, a kinase inhibitor specific to EGFR can sensitize tumors to gemcitabine in PDAC models 30 . Therefore, we hypothesized that it might be possible to improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in PDAC when combined with DTLL.\nIn the present study, we investigated differences in the genetic and expression profiles of the main driver genes in PDAC between the AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines, followed with evaluation of DTLL efficacy when given in combination with gemcitabine by using gemcitabine-sensitive and gemcitabine-resistant PDAC models. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of the combination treatment and further elucidate the mechanism of this strategy. Our findings demonstrated that DTLL provided a promising synergistic therapeutic strategy but enhanced the susceptibility of both gemcitabine-sensitive and gemcitabine-resistant PDAC tumors through different signaling pathways.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 33, "DISEASE"], [35, 39, "DISEASE"], [76, 82, "DISEASE"], [124, 130, "DISEASE"], [216, 220, "DISEASE"], [305, 309, "DISEASE"], [433, 450, "DISEASE"], [504, 521, "DISEASE"], [583, 587, "DISEASE"], [614, 622, "RELATION"], [623, 627, "GENE"], [636, 656, "RELATION"], [691, 697, "GENE"], [705, 709, "GENE"], [720, 725, "GENE"], [734, 738, "GENE"], [750, 758, "RELATION"], [782, 787, "GENE"], [974, 978, "DISEASE"], [1212, 1216, "DISEASE"], [1369, 1394, "DISEASE"], [1471, 1475, "GENE"], [1582, 1600, "DISEASE"], [1605, 1609, "GENE"], [1628, 1632, "RELATION"], [1636, 1644, "RELATION"], [1648, 1652, "GENE"], [1688, 1692, "DISEASE"], [1703, 1706, "GENE"], [1707, 1713, "GENE"], [1726, 1743, "DISEASE"], [1798, 1802, "GENE"], [1803, 1808, "GENE"], [1936, 1940, "GENE"], [1945, 1950, "GENE"], [1993, 2010, "DISEASE"], [2029, 2034, "GENE"], [2035, 2039, "RELATION"], [2043, 2060, "DISEASE"], [2178, 2193, "RELATION"], [2221, 2225, "DISEASE"], [2244, 2249, "GENE"], [2272, 2281, "GENE"], [2336, 2340, "DISEASE"], [2355, 2360, "GENE"], [2435, 2439, "DISEASE"], [2440, 2449, "DISEASE"], [2568, 2572, "DISEASE"], [2810, 2814, "GENE"], [2815, 2833, "RELATION"], [2852, 2856, "DISEASE"], [3080, 3084, "GENE"], [3089, 3093, "GENE"], [3203, 3207, "GENE"], [3212, 3216, "GENE"], [3350, 3367, "DISEASE"], [3373, 3377, "DISEASE"], [3387, 3404, "DISEASE"], [3475, 3479, "GENE"], [3480, 3484, "GENE"], [3507, 3510, "GENE"], [3511, 3515, "GENE"], [3530, 3535, "GENE"], [3583, 3587, "DISEASE"]], [[3624, 3641, "DISEASE"], [[3675, 3690], [3679, 3700], "RELATION"], [3680, 3684, "GENE"], [3685, 3689, "GENE"], [4080, 4097, "DISEASE"], [4161, 4165, "GENE"], [4188, 4192, "DISEASE"], [4404, 4421, "DISEASE"], [4472, 4476, "GENE"], [4516, 4520, "DISEASE"], [4645, 4649, "DISEASE"], [4792, 4796, "DISEASE"], [4985, 4989, "DISEASE"], [5299, 5303, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[623, 627, 583, 587, "causative mutation"], [691, 697, 583, 587, "decreased expression"], [705, 709, 583, 587, "decreased expression"], [720, 725, 583, 587, "decreased expression"], [734, 738, 583, 587, "decreased expression"], [782, 787, 583, 587, "associated mutation"], [1648, 1652, 1688, 1692, "decreased expression"], [1648, 1652, 1688, 1692, "associated mutation"], [2029, 2034, 2043, 2060, "decreased expression"], [2029, 2034, 2043, 2060, "therapy resistance"], [2810, 2814, 2852, 2856, "therapeutic target"]], [[3680, 3684, 3624, 3641, "increased expression"], [3685, 3689, 4080, 4097, "increased expression"]]], "triplets": [[[623, 627, 583, 587, 614, 622], [691, 697, 583, 587, 636, 656], [705, 709, 583, 587, 636, 656], [720, 725, 583, 587, 636, 656], [734, 738, 583, 587, 636, 656], [782, 787, 583, 587, 750, 758], [1648, 1652, 1688, 1692, 1628, 1632], [1648, 1652, 1688, 1692, 1636, 1644], [2029, 2034, 2043, 2060, 2035, 2039], [2029, 2034, 2043, 2060, 2178, 2193], [2810, 2814, 2852, 2856, 2815, 2833]], [[3680, 3684, 3624, 3641, [3675, 3690], [3679, 3700]], [3685, 3689, 4080, 4097, [3675, 3690], [3679, 3700]]]], "triplets_text": [[["KRAS", "PDAC", "oncogene"], ["CDKN2A", "PDAC", "inactivation or loss"], ["TP53", "PDAC", "inactivation or loss"], ["SMAD4", "PDAC", "inactivation or loss"], ["PTEN", "PDAC", "inactivation or loss"], ["BRCA2", "PDAC", "mutation"], ["TP53", "PDAC", "loss"], ["TP53", "PDAC", "mutation"], ["SMAD4", "pancreatic cancer", "loss"], ["SMAD4", "pancreatic cancer", "chemoresistance"], ["EGFR", "PDAC", "targeted therapies"]], [["EGFR", "pancreatic cancer", "high expression"], ["HER2", "pancreatic cancer", "high expression"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death and is the most aggressive cancer with a five-year survival of <5% 1 , 2 .

{"doc_key": "9489697_Abstract", "text": ["\nTitle: An EGFR/HER2-targeted conjugate sensitizes gemcitabine-sensitive and resistant pancreatic cancer through different SMAD4-mediated mechanisms.\nAbstract: Chemoresistance limits its clinical implementation for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We previously generated an EGFR/HER2 targeted conjugate, dual-targeting ligand-based lidamycin (DTLL), which shows a highly potent antitumor effect. To overcome chemoresistance in PDAC, we aim to study DTLL efficacy when combined with gemcitabine and explore its mechanisms of action. DTLL in combination with gemcitabine show a superior inhibitory effect on the growth of gemcitabine-resistant/sensitive tumors. DTLL sensitizes gemcitabine efficacy via distinct action mechanisms mediated by mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4). It not only prevents neoplastic proliferation via ATK/mTOR blockade and NF-\u03baB impaired function in SMAD4-sufficient PDACs, but also restores SMAD4 bioactivity to trigger downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling in SMAD4-deficient tumors and to overcome chemoresistance.

We previously generated an EGFR/HER2 targeted conjugate, dual-targeting ligand-based lidamycin (DTLL), which shows a highly potent antitumor effect. To overcome chemoresistance in PDAC, we aim to study DTLL efficacy when combined with gemcitabine and explore its mechanisms of action. DTLL in combination with gemcitabine show a superior inhibitory effect on the growth of gemcitabine-resistant/sensitive tumors. DTLL sensitizes gemcitabine efficacy via distinct action mechanisms mediated by mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4). It not only prevents neoplastic proliferation via ATK/mTOR blockade and NF-\u03baB impaired function in SMAD4-sufficient PDACs, but also restores SMAD4 bioactivity to trigger downstream NF-\u03baB-regulated signaling in SMAD4-deficient tumors and to overcome chemoresistance. DTLL seems to act as a SMAD4 module that normalizes its function in PDAC, having a synergistic effect in combination with gemcitabine. Our findings provide insight into a rational SMAD4-directed precision therapy in PDAC.\nChemoresistance is a main limitation for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

{"doc_key": "9886470_4. Discussion Rev", "text": ["\nPrevious research found various immune evasion pathways in lymphomas, persuading that deception from antitumor immunity was required for the pathogenesis of lymphoma [ 66 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 signaling is one way cancers bypass the immune system [ 67 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 signaling has a major role in lymphocyte malfunction. However, anti-PDL1/PD-1 antibodies do not consistently reverse this mechanism, suggesting that other molecules may contribute to lymphocyte depletion [ 68 ]. The study assessed PD-L1/PD-1 expression in circulating CXCR3 and CD36-positive lymphocytes in lymphoma.\nIn this study, the percentage of peripheral CXCR3 and CD36 positive lymphocytes differed significantly between lymphoma patients and healthy controls. In earlier studies, investigations revealed that CXCR3 expression was restricted to activated T lymphocytes [ 69 ] and that CXCR3 and CD36 expression was detected in small percentages of peripheral lymphocytes [ 33 ,  70 ]. Other studies found that individuals with various forms of lymphoma had a higher percentage of peripheral CD36 and CXCR3+ lymphocytes, implying that lymphoma patients have an immunological defect [ 71 ,  72 ].\nPD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes has not been studied in lymphoma. In lymphomas, coexpression was observed in peripheral lymphocytes but not healthy controls. A prior study revealed high PD-1/PD-L1expression in subjects with tumors than in healthy controls [ 73 ]. PD-L1 expression was associated with CD36 expression [ 74 ], and its enhancement was via CXCR3 in an Akt and STAT3-dependent manner [ 75 ]. The findings presuppose that CXCR3/CD36 and PDL1/PD-1 coexpression have a crucial role in lymphoma development, suggesting using this coexpression as a diagnostic test in managing lymphoma.\nA significant increase in PD-1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% was observed in subjects with extranodal involvement than in patients without extranodal involvement, giving evidence for the association between these cells and extranodal involvement's pathogenesis. CXCR3 expression in peripheral lymphocytes might fluctuate with the clinical outcome as T cell activation and differentiation regulates its expression [ 76 ]. The results might be the outcome of the immune system and lymphoma interaction, assuming that PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3 positive lymphocytes is engaged in tumor invasion and extranodal involvement in lymphoma. Another scenario might be due to the PD-L1+CXCR3 and PD-1+CXCR3 cell-mediated tolerance state, enabling extranodal involvement in lymphoma. PD-L1 and CXCR3 expressions were associated with tumor progression and a worse prognosis [ 67 ,  77 ].\nHigh percentages of circulating PD+L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes were found in lymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement. CD36 contributed to tumor growth and progression [ 35 ] and was associated with PD-L1 expression [ 74 ]. Moreover, CD36 induced reprogramming of the lipid uptake in tumor cells, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [ 78 ]. CD36 blocking might be a potential new lymphoma therapy [ 79 ]. CD36 can attach to transmembrane proteins on the surface of cells, such as PD-L1/PD-1, which might induce signal transduction and ligand binding. Lymphoma progression and extranodal involvement in lymphomas could be initiated by PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CD36.\nThe findings revealed that lymphoma patients' peripheral CXCR3-positive lymphocytes have high PD-L1/PD-1 expression levels. CXCR3+PD-L1+%, on the other hand, was 5-6 times higher than CXCR3+PD-1+%. The data reveal that PD-L1, but not PD-1, is involved in lymphoma emergence by mediating extranodal involvement, assuming that PD-L1 might be the most significant molecule in the extranodal involvement of lymphoma. Previous studies demonstrated that CXCL10 could activate the p44/42 ERK and Akt signaling pathways and activate p38 MAPK in T lymphocytes, enhancing apoptosis [ 80 ]. According to the findings, the negative PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in circulating lymphocytes might be via CXCR3 or CD36. Another scenario is that CXCR3 and CD36 might increase PD-L1/PD-1 expression, enhancing CXCR3/CD36 and PD-L1/PD-1 crosstalk. The coexpression of these molecules may act as inhibitory molecules by inducing lymphocyte apoptosis, which may be linked to the pathogenesis and etiology of lymphoma extranodal involvement. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 could significantly impact clinical lymphoma activity.\nIn lymphoma patients without extranodal involvement, posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1 and CXCR3/CD36 coexpression were reduced, suggesting that chemotherapy might induce a disruption in PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. In patients who had achieved remission, PD-L1 expression was reduced [ 81 ]. By reducing PD-1 expression in peripheral lymphocytes and enhancing the immune response, chemotherapy may serve as an effective antitumor treatment [ 82 ]. Chemotherapy may increase the nuclear expression of PD-1/PD-L1 while decreasing the surface expression [ 83 ]. Low PD-L1/PD-1+CD36 percentages promote peripheral cell proliferation, providing a possible antitumor mechanism in lymphoma. The findings assumed that the relevance of immune cells in antitumor immunity could be determined by the decline in PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes.\nCompared to healthy controls, sera from lymphoma patients had a higher concentration of IL-19. The findings appeared to be consistent with prior studies that showed an elevation of IL-19 in patients with NHL compared to normal controls [ 42 ]. IL-19 levels were associated with high LDH levels. High LDH levels were associated with inferior prognosis in lymphoma [ 84 ]. In the current study, patients with extranodal involvement had significantly higher IL-19 levels than patients without extranodal involvement. Previous studies revealed IL-19 association with tumor metastasis and poor clinical outcomes [ 43 ,  44 ]. This refers to the significance of employing IL-19 to identify extranodal involvement, implying earlier treatment and increased endurance.\nCXCR3+ and PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were significantly associated with high LDH levels. Furthermore, these cells were negatively associated with albumin levels, which agreed with previous reports [ 85 ]. This observation suggested a key role for CXCR3+, PD-L1+CXCR3+, and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes in lymphoma pathogenesis and progression.\nThe results indicated that CXCR3+, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were associated with poor prognostic features such as hepatomegaly, staging, splenomegaly, and recurrence. Previous studies reported the high expression of CXCR3, and PD-L1/PD-1 was related to cancer invasion [ 86 - 90 ]. PD-L1+CXCR3+ and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes might be involved in inferior prognosis in lymphoma.\nIn this current study, some clinical criteria were significantly associated with high IL-19 levels. Pretherapy IL-19 levels were significantly associated with both hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Moreover, IL-19 levels had a significant correlation with lymphedema and recurrence. Previous studies showed the association between high IL-19 levels and inferior clinical outcomes [ 44 ], assuming a major role for IL-19 in lymphoma progression.\nBone marrow, lung, and lymph vessel involvement were positively correlated with CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% of cells. PD-L1+CXCR3+ cells majorly mediate the metastasis of melanoma and colon carcinoma [ 23 ,  24 ]. Interestingly, PD-L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes mediate lung and bone marrow involvement. Lymphoma prognosis is closely associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement [ 3 ,  91 ]. To our knowledge, these findings have not been reported before. PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3+ cells might represent a novel and critical prognostic marker as their expression was related to extranodal involvement and prognosis. A possible scenario is that PD-L1 and CXCR3 function as immune-suppressive agents in cancer [ 92 ,  93 ].\nThis study revealed that high IL-19 levels were associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement. In former studies, IL-19 levels were related to poor prognosis and metastasis [ 94 ]. Interestingly, an association between lung involvement and higher serum IL-19 levels was observed in lymphoma. According to the findings, IL-19 could be a biomarker for extranodal lymphoma involvement.\nThis study linked high percentages of PD-L1+CXCR3+, PD-1+CXCR3+, and high IL-19 levels to shorter EFS. The results also assume that posttherapy PDL1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+ percentages are correlated with poor prognosis, considering prognostic biomarkers in lymphoma patients. High expression of PD-1/PD-1 is confined to poor prognosis in lymphoma [ 95 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 might play an inferior prognostic role in lymphoma, providing a new significant era in lymphoma immunotherapy, especially in patients with extranodal involvement.\nPD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in identifying patients with extranodal involvement was assessed using ROC curves. The AUCs of the pre- and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+% were 0.981 and 0.961, respectively, with high specificity and sensitivity. The cut-off values were >33 and >40. CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% yielded the best sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the ROC curve was assessed for posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1+CD36+ percentages. The AUCs were 0.694 and 0.769, with reduced sensitivity and specificity. Thus, according to the findings, PD-L1/PD-1+CD36+% is insufficient for identifying extranodal involvement in lymphoma patients. Furthermore, the pretherapy IL-19 ROC curves demonstrated a pattern of extranodal involvement ( AUC  = 0.993 and  P  < 0.001). The specificity and sensitivity were 97.73% and 100% at a cut-off >280 pg/mL.\nThis study had some limitations: (1) the small size of the subjects in this study; (2) short follow-up time, longer follow-up, and multicenter collaborations are needed to confirm PD-L1/PD-1's role; (3) PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 should be investigated in tumor tissue; (4) cell function activities such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokine release were not carried out; future research will investigate these issues; (5) PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 was not investigated in different lymphocyte subsets; further studies are required.\nIn conclusion, PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and serum IL-19 may be involved in lymphoma extranodal involvement and have prognostic and predictive values in lymphoma. The findings could also shed light on the role of circulating CXCR3 and CD36-positive lymphocyte cells in lymphoma. Future clinical trials and research are required to create new treatments based on PD-L1/PD-1-induced lymphoma immune evasion mechanisms and host immune response regulation. The combination of PD-L1/PD-1 blockades, anti-CXCR3/CD36, and IL-19 monoclonal antibody therapy might start a new era for immunotherapy. PD-L1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes and serum IL-19 might play a more important role in poor clinical behavior in lymphoma.\n"], "ner": [[[60, 68, "DISEASE"], [158, 166, "DISEASE"], [175, 180, "GENE"], [181,

deception from antitumor immunity was required for the pathogenesis of lymphoma [ 66 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 signaling is one way cancers bypass the immune system [ 67 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 signaling has a major role in lymphocyte malfunction. However, anti-PDL1/PD-1 antibodies do not consistently reverse this mechanism, suggesting that other molecules may contribute to lymphocyte depletion [ 68 ]. The study assessed PD-L1/PD-1 expression in circulating CXCR3 and CD36-positive lymphocytes in lymphoma.\nIn this study, the percentage of peripheral CXCR3 and CD36 positive lymphocytes differed significantly between lymphoma patients and healthy controls. In earlier studies, investigations revealed that CXCR3 expression was restricted to activated T lymphocytes [ 69 ] and that CXCR3 and CD36 expression was detected in small percentages of peripheral lymphocytes [ 33 ,  70 ]. Other studies found that individuals with various forms of lymphoma had a higher percentage of peripheral CD36 and CXCR3+ lymphocytes, implying that lymphoma patients have an immunological defect [ 71 ,  72 ].\nPD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes has not been studied in lymphoma. In lymphomas, coexpression was observed in peripheral lymphocytes but not healthy controls. A prior study revealed high PD-1/PD-L1expression in subjects with tumors than in healthy controls [ 73 ]. PD-L1 expression was associated with CD36 expression [ 74 ], and its enhancement was via CXCR3 in an Akt and STAT3-dependent manner [ 75 ]. The findings presuppose that CXCR3/CD36 and PDL1/PD-1 coexpression have a crucial role in lymphoma development, suggesting using this coexpression as a diagnostic test in managing lymphoma.\nA significant increase in PD-1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% was observed in subjects with extranodal involvement than in patients without extranodal involvement, giving evidence for the association between these cells and extranodal involvement's pathogenesis. CXCR3 expression in peripheral lymphocytes might fluctuate with the clinical outcome as T cell activation and differentiation regulates its expression [ 76 ]. The results might be the outcome of the immune system and lymphoma interaction, assuming that PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3 positive lymphocytes is engaged in tumor invasion and extranodal involvement in lymphoma. Another scenario might be due to the PD-L1+CXCR3 and PD-1+CXCR3 cell-mediated tolerance state, enabling extranodal involvement in lymphoma. PD-L1 and CXCR3 expressions were associated with tumor progression and a worse prognosis [ 67 ,  77 ].\nHigh percentages of circulating PD+L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes were found in lymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement. CD36 contributed to tumor growth and progression [ 35 ] and was associated with PD-L1 expression [ 74 ]. Moreover, CD36 induced reprogramming of the lipid uptake in tumor cells, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [ 78 ]. CD36 blocking might be a potential new lymphoma therapy [ 79 ]. CD36 can attach to transmembrane proteins on the surface of cells, such as PD-L1/PD-1, which might induce signal transduction and ligand binding. Lymphoma progression and extranodal involvement in lymphomas could be initiated by PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CD36.\nThe findings revealed that lymphoma patients' peripheral CXCR3-positive lymphocytes have high PD-L1/PD-1 expression levels. CXCR3+PD-L1+%, on the other hand, was 5-6 times higher than CXCR3+PD-1+%. The data reveal that PD-L1, but not PD-1, is involved in lymphoma emergence by mediating extranodal involvement, assuming that PD-L1 might be the most significant molecule in the extranodal involvement of lymphoma. Previous studies demonstrated that CXCL10 could activate the p44/42 ERK and Akt signaling pathways and activate p38 MAPK in T lymphocytes, enhancing apoptosis [ 80 ]. According to the findings, the negative PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in circulating l", "ymphocytes might be via CXCR3 or CD36. Another scenario is that CXCR3 and CD36 might increase PD-L1/PD-1 expression, enhancing CXCR3/CD36 and PD-L1/PD-1 crosstalk. The coexpression of these molecules may act as inhibitory molecules by inducing lymphocyte apoptosis, which may be linked to the pathogenesis and etiology of lymphoma extranodal involvement. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 could significantly impact clinical lymphoma activity.\nIn lymphoma patients without extranodal involvement, posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1 and CXCR3/CD36 coexpression were reduced, suggesting that chemotherapy might induce a disruption in PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. In patients who had achieved remission, PD-L1 expression was reduced [ 81 ]. By reducing PD-1 expression in peripheral lymphocytes and enhancing the immune response, chemotherapy may serve as an effective antitumor treatment [ 82 ]. Chemotherapy may increase the nuclear expression of PD-1/PD-L1 while decreasing the surface expression [ 83 ]. Low PD-L1/PD-1+CD36 percentages promote peripheral cell proliferation, providing a possible antitumor mechanism in lymphoma. The findings assumed that the relevance of immune cells in antitumor immunity could be determined by the decline in PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes.\nCompared to healthy controls, sera from lymphoma patients had a higher concentration of IL-19. The findings appeared to be consistent with prior studies that showed an elevation of IL-19 in patients with NHL compared to normal controls [ 42 ]. IL-19 levels were associated with high LDH levels. High LDH levels were associated with inferior prognosis in lymphoma [ 84 ]. In the current study, patients with extranodal involvement had significantly higher IL-19 levels than patients without extranodal involvement. Previous studies revealed IL-19 association with tumor metastasis and poor clinical outcomes [ 43 ,  44 ]. This refers to the significance of employing IL-19 to identify extranodal involvement, implying earlier treatment and increased endurance.\nCXCR3+ and PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were significantly associated with high LDH levels. Furthermore, these cells were negatively associated with albumin levels, which agreed with previous reports [ 85 ]. This observation suggested a key role for CXCR3+, PD-L1+CXCR3+, and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes in lymphoma pathogenesis and progression.\nThe results indicated that CXCR3+, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were associated with poor prognostic features such as hepatomegaly, staging, splenomegaly, and recurrence. Previous studies reported the high expression of CXCR3, and PD-L1/PD-1 was related to cancer invasion [ 86 - 90 ]. PD-L1+CXCR3+ and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes might be involved in inferior prognosis in lymphoma.\nIn this current study, some clinical criteria were significantly associated with high IL-19 levels. Pretherapy IL-19 levels were significantly associated with both hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Moreover, IL-19 levels had a significant correlation with lymphedema and recurrence. Previous studies showed the association between high IL-19 levels and inferior clinical outcomes [ 44 ], assuming a major role for IL-19 in lymphoma progression.\nBone marrow, lung, and lymph vessel involvement were positively correlated with CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% of cells. PD-L1+CXCR3+ cells majorly mediate the metastasis of melanoma and colon carcinoma [ 23 ,  24 ]. Interestingly, PD-L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes mediate lung and bone marrow involvement. Lymphoma prognosis is closely associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement [ 3 ,  91 ]. To our knowledge, these findings have not been reported before. PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3+ cells might represent a novel and critical prognostic marker as their expression was related to extranodal involvement and prognosis. A possible scenario is that PD-L1 and CXCR3 function as immune-suppressive agents in cancer [ 92 ,  93 ].", "\nThis study revealed that high IL-19 levels were associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement. In former studies, IL-19 levels were related to poor prognosis and metastasis [ 94 ]. Interestingly, an association between lung involvement and higher serum IL-19 levels was observed in lymphoma. According to the findings, IL-19 could be a biomarker for extranodal lymphoma involvement.\nThis study linked high percentages of PD-L1+CXCR3+, PD-1+CXCR3+, and high IL-19 levels to shorter EFS. The results also assume that posttherapy PDL1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+ percentages are correlated with poor prognosis, considering prognostic biomarkers in lymphoma patients. High expression of PD-1/PD-1 is confined to poor prognosis in lymphoma [ 95 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 might play an inferior prognostic role in lymphoma, providing a new significant era in lymphoma immunotherapy, especially in patients with extranodal involvement.\nPD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in identifying patients with extranodal involvement was assessed using ROC curves. The AUCs of the pre- and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+% were 0.981 and 0.961, respectively, with high specificity and sensitivity. The cut-off values were >33 and >40. CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% yielded the best sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the ROC curve was assessed for posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1+CD36+ percentages. The AUCs were 0.694 and 0.769, with reduced sensitivity and specificity. Thus, according to the findings, PD-L1/PD-1+CD36+% is insufficient for identifying extranodal involvement in lymphoma patients. Furthermore, the pretherapy IL-19 ROC curves demonstrated a pattern of extranodal involvement ( AUC  = 0.993 and  P  < 0.001). The specificity and sensitivity were 97.73% and 100% at a cut-off >280 pg/mL.\nThis study had some limitations: (1) the small size of the subjects in this study; (2) short follow-up time, longer follow-up, and multicenter collaborations are needed to confirm PD-L1/PD-1's role; (3) PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 should be investigated in tumor tissue; (4) cell function activities such as differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and cytokine release were not carried out; future research will investigate these issues; (5) PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 was not investigated in different lymphocyte subsets; further studies are required.\nIn conclusion, PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and serum IL-19 may be involved in lymphoma extranodal involvement and have prognostic and predictive values in lymphoma. The findings could also shed light on the role of circulating CXCR3 and CD36-positive lymphocyte cells in lymphoma. Future clinical trials and research are required to create new treatments based on PD-L1/PD-1-induced lymphoma immune evasion mechanisms and host immune response regulation. The combination of PD-L1/PD-1 blockades, anti-CXCR3/CD36, and IL-19 monoclonal antibody therapy might start a new era for immunotherapy. PD-L1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes and serum IL-19 might play a more important role in poor clinical behavior in lymphoma.\n"]}

Healthy volunteers ranged in age from 24 to 81 years old. Seventy-eight lymphoma subjects ranged in age from 11 to 81 years, including 39 males and 39 females. The criteria for all subjects are listed in (Supplementary Table  1 ).\nAfter therapy and follow-up, there were 34 lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement and 44 without extranodal involvement. Patients with extranodal involvement had a mean age of 42.81 \u00b1 7.6, ranging from 11 to 81, while those without extranodal involvement had a mean age of 42 \u00b1 16.1, ranging from 18 to 75. Supplementary Table  2  reveals no significant differences regarding age, lymphoma types, and subtypes between patients without extranodal involvement ( N  = 34) and patients with extranodal involvement ( N  = 34). Lymphoma patients with and without extranodal involvement revealed statistical significance regarding sex ( P  = 0.039), stage ( P  < 0.001), recurrence ( P  < 0.001), and death ( P  = 0.018). Among lymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement, 73.5% had a recurrence, and 20.6% died. 26.5% of patients with extranodal involvement presented with stage III diseases, while 58.8% had stage IV diseases. Only 2.9% of patients with extranodal involvement had stage I, and 11.8% had stage II (Supplementary Table  2 ).\nThe different extranodal involvement sites in lymphoma patients are shown in  Table 1 . Bone marrow involvement and lymph vessel infiltration were found in 33.3% and 21.8% of patients, respectively. 12.8% of patients presented with lung involvement, while approximately 10.3% had spleen infiltration. Furthermore, 9% of lymphoma patients showed liver involvement. Only 1.3% of patients had involvement of the intestine, thyroid, or central nervous system ( Table 1 ).\n3.2. High PD-L1/PD-1 Expression in Circulating CD36+ and CXCR3+ Lymphocytes in Newly Diagnosed Lymphoma Patients\nFlow cytometric analysis investigated CD36 and CXCR3 expression in peripheral lymphocytes in 78 newly diagnosed lymphoma patients and 50 healthy controls. Lymphocyte gating was shown in Supplementary Figures  1-4 . CD36 and CXCR3 positive lymphocytes were found in small percentages in healthy controls (median: 4.2% (range: 3.5-5.7) and median: 11.2% (range: 9.7-13.2)). High pretherapy CXCR3+% and CD36+% of cells were observed in lymphoma patients than in normal volunteers (median: 40% vs. 11.2%; 13% vs. 4.2%,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).\nThe study then examined whether peripheral CD36 and CXCR3 positive lymphocytes expressed PD-L1 and PD-1. Compared to healthy controls, newly diagnosed lymphoma patients had higher PD-L1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% (32% vs. 1.1%; 10% vs. 0.7%,  P  < 0.001). Interestingly, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% in newly diagnosed lymphoma subjects were significantly higher than in healthy volunteers (median: 8% vs. 1%; 5 vs. 0.2,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).\n3.3. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3+/CD36 Defines Extranodal Involvement in Lymphoma\nExtranodal involvement of lymphoma indicates an inferior prognosis for lymphoma. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes was investigated in posttherapy lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement ( n  = 34) or without extranodal involvement ( n  = 44) ( Figure 1 ). Posttherapy 34 lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement were characterized by higher percentages of peripheral CXCR3 positive lymphocytes than those in posttherapy 44 patients without extranodal involvement (median: 78% vs. 26%,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ). When considering circulating CD36+ lymphocytes, CD36+% was lower in extranodal involvement compared with subjects without extranodal involvement (median: 27% vs. 55.5%,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ).\nLymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement had higher PD-L1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% compared with subjects without extranodal involvement (median 65% vs. 4%; 12.2% vs. 2%,  P  < 0.001, respectively) (Figures  1(a) - 1(d) ). Furthermore, PD-L1+CD36% and PD-1+CD36+% were significantly higher in subjects with extranodal involvement compared with patients without extranodal involvement (median 22 vs. 8,  P  = 0.004; 5.8% vs. 1%,  P  < 0.001) (Figures  1(e) - 1(h) ).\nA significant increase in posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes was detected in the extranodal involvement group compared with the pretherapy samples of the same group (Supplementary Table  3 ). However, lymphoma patients without extranodal involvement had a lower posttherapy PDL-1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 than in the pretherapy samples of the same patients (Supplementary Table  4 ).\n3.4. IL-19 in Lymphoma Patients\nNewly diagnosed 78 lymphoma patients had significantly higher IL-19 levels than normal volunteers (median = 237 vs. 7.2 pg/mL,  P  < 0.001). Moreover, lymphoma patients had higher posttherapy IL-19 levels than the normal controls (median: 219 vs. 7,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(a) ).\nPosttherapy IL-19 levels were detected in lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement, and the median level was 628 pg/mL (range: 439-817.3), which was significantly higher than that of subjects without extranodal invasion with a median of 46.5 pg/mL (range: 33-137.5) ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(b) ). Interestingly, compared to patients without extranodal involvement, lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement had higher pretherapy IL-19 levels (median: 525 vs. 100,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(b) ).\n3.5. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3+/CD36 and IL-19 Defines Lymphoma Clinical Outcome\nPatients with CR had significantly lower pretherapy IL-19, CXCR3+%, and PD-L1+CXCR3+% compared to the PR, recurrence, and refractory groups ( P  < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the PR, recurrence, and refractory groups, the CR group had a significant reduction in posttherapy IL-19, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% ( P  < 0.05). Additionally, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% were significantly lower in subjects with CR compared to the other groups. Contrarily, comparing the CR group to the other groups, there was a substantial rise in posttherapy CD36+% ( P  < 0.001,  P  < 0.001, and  P  = 0.010) ( Table 3 ).\nThe CR group showed a significant reduction in pretherapy PD-1+CXCR3+% and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+% compared to the PR group and recurrence group ( P  < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed when subjects with CR were compared to the treatment-refractory patients ( P  = 0.092 and  P  = 0.055). In addition, the CR patients' PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+ % were significantly lower than those in the PR group ( P  = 0.037 and  P  = 0.002). However, no significant difference was detected between the CR group and the recurrence group or the refractory group ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 3 ).\nPretherapy IL-19 levels, CXCR3+%, and PD-L1+CXCR3+% in lymphoma patients with recurrence were statistically higher than in the PR patients ( P  < 0.001). Additionally, the recurrence group's posttherapy IL-19 levels, PD-L1+CXCR3+, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were significantly higher than those of PR patients ( P  = 0.018,  P  = 0.013, and  P  = 0.011) ( Table 3 ). Furthermore, pretherapy PD-1+CD36+% and posttherapy CD36+% in patients with recurrence were significantly lower than in PR patients ( P  = 0.022 and  P  = 0.002). However, no significant differences were observed when the treatment-refractory group compared to PR or recurrence groups ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 3 ).\n3.6. Correlation between PDL-1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36, IL-19, and Laboratory and Clinical Criteria\nThe results revealed a positive association between pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3%, and LDH ( r  = 0.344,  P  = 0.002;  r  = 0.375,  P  = 0.001;  r  = 0.315,  P  = 0.005, respectively). However, negative associations between CXCR3+%, PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3%, and albumin levels were identified ( r  = -0.269;  P  = 0.017;  r  = -0.326,  P  = 0.004;  r  = -0.337,  P  = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, there was a negative association between PD-L1+CXCR3+% and hemoglobin ( r  = -0.254,  P  = 0.025) ( Table 4 ).\nCXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively correlated with hepatomegaly ( r  = 0.464,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.398,  P  < 0.001,  r  = 0.335,  P  = 0.003). Data revealed that CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% positively correlated with lymphoma stages ( r  = 0.498,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.437,  P  < 0.001,  r  = 0.333,  P  = 0.002) ( Table 4 ). Moreover, CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% associated positively with both splenomegaly ( r  = 0.348,  P  = 0.002;  r  = 0.268,  P  = 0.018) and general lymphadenopathy ( r  = 0.362,  P  = 0.001;  r  = 0.304,  P  = 0.007). Furthermore, CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% positively correlated with BCR-ABL ( r  = 0.262,  P  = 0.020;  r  = 0.271,  P  = 0.016). Additionally, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% had a significant association with lymphoma recurrence ( r  = 0.645,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.676,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.310,  P  = 0.006) ( Table 4 ). CD36+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CD36+% were associated with some of clinical parameters but without significance ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 4 ).\nInterestingly, pretherapy IL-19 was positively correlated with LDH levels ( r  = 0.349 and  P  = 0.002), hepatomegaly ( r  = 0.362 and  P  = 0.001), and splenomegaly ( r  = 0.231 and  P  = 0.042). Furthermore, pretherapy IL-19 levels were significantly associated with lymphedema, general lymphadenopathy, and recurrence ( r  = 0.426,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.239,  P  = 0.035;  r  = 0.641,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 4 ).\n3.7. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 and CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 Is Associated with Extranodal Involvement\nPosttherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively associated with extranodal involvement ( r  = 0.771,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.793,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.528,  P  < 0.001). CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% had a positive association with bone marrow involvement ( r  = 0.645,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.676,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.369,  P  < 0.001). Moreover, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively associated with lymph vessel involvement ( r  = 0.499,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.487,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.272,  P  = 0.016). Additionally, a significant association between CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, PD-1+CXCR3+%, and lung involvement was identified ( r  = 0.277,  P  = 0.014;  r  = 0.286,  P  = 0.011;  r  = 0.235,  P  = 0.038) ( Table 5 ).\nPosttherapy PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-L1+CD36+% were positively correlated with extranodal involvement ( r  = 0.333,  P  = 0.003;  r  = 0.469,  P  < 0.001), while CD36+% had a negative association with extranodal involvement ( r  = -0.792 and  P  < 0.001). Of interest, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% were positively correlated with bone marrow infiltration ( r  = 0.312,  P  = 0.005;  r  = 0.390,  P  < 0.001). PD-1+CD36+% was positively correlated with lung involvement ( r  = 0.234;  P  = 0.040). CD36% was negatively correlated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement ( r  = -0.633,  P  < 0.001;  r  = -0.386,  P  < 0.001). Furthermore, percentages of CD36+ lymphocytes were correlated with spleen infiltration ( r  = 0.327;  P  = 0.004) ( Table 5 ).\nIL-19 concentrations and extranodal involvement were positively correlated ( r  = 0.848;  P  < 0.001). IL-19 levels are positively associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement ( r  = 0.637,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.437,  P  < 0.001). Similarly, a positive association between posttherapy IL-19 levels and lung involvement was identified ( r  = 0.278;  P  = 0.014) ( Table 5 ).\n3.8. Prognostic Value of PD-L1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19\nThe effect of the markers on EFS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier statistics ( Figure 3 ). Survival tree analysis identified that CXCR3+ and PD-L1+CXCR3+ staining percentages more than 50% were considered high, whereas those \u226450% were regarded as low staining. PD-1+CXCR3+ and PD-L1+CD36+ staining percentages more than 7% were considered high, whereas those \u22647% were regarded as low staining.\nThere was a high reduction in EFS in lymphoma patients with high percentages of pre- and posttherapy CXCR3+ lymphocytes ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(a)  and  3(e) ). Moreover, pre- and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were negatively associated with EFS ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(b)  and  3(f) ). Patients' EFS was significantly decreased when their initial PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocyte percentages were high ( P  = 0.022) ( Figure 3(c) ). High pre-T IL-19 levels were associated with inferior EFS ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure 3(d) ). A prolonged EFS was predicted by low posttherapy PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(g)  and  3(h) ).\nThe effect of the immune markers on overall survival and recurrence-free survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier statistics (data not shown). Patients with low pre- and posttherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXC3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% do better than those with a high percentage. Furthermore, low PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-L1+CD36+% predicted a more prolonged survival and recurrence-free time.\n3.9. Diagnostic Utility of PD-L1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 in Identifying Extranodal Involvement\n\n Figure 4  shows the ROC analysis for predicting extranodal involvement in lymphoma. Pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% could predict extranodal involvement with AUCs of 0.982, 0.981, and 0.764 (95% CI = 0.922 - 0.999; 0.921-0.999; 0.654-0.853;  P  < 0.001, respectively) (Figures  4(a) - 4(c) ). Pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% cut-offs were >41, >33, and >11, respectively. Moreover, pretherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% sensitivities were 97.06%, 97.06%, and 61.67%, and the specificities were 97.73%, 97.73%, and 79.55%. Pretherapy CXCR3+% and PDL-1+CXCR3+ had the best sensitivity and specificity. Pretherapy IL-19 levels could predict extranodal involvement with an AUC of 0.909 (95% CI = 0.822 - 0.962,  P  < 0.001). The pretherapy IL-19 cut-off was >209 pg/mL, with specificity and sensitivity 75% and 91.18% ( Figure 4(d) ).\nPosttherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% could diagnose lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement. Posttherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% AUCs were 0.949, 0.961, and 0.805 ( P  < 0.001) at a cutoff >49, >40, and >3, respectively (Figures  5(a) - 5(c) ). Posttherapy PD-1+CXCR3+% had the best sensitivity of 100%, while PD-L1+CXCR3+% and CXCR3+% had the best specificity of 100%.\nMoreover, the AUC values of the posttherapy CD36+%, PDL-1+CD36+%, and PD-1+CD36+% for extranodal involvement diagnosis were 0.961, 0.694, and 0.769 (95% CI = 0.890 - 0.992; 0.579-0.793; 0.659-0.857, respectively). Posttherapy CD36+%, PDL-1+CD36+%, and PD-1+CD36+% had cutoff levels \u226437, > 11, and>3 ( P  < 0.001,  P  = 0.002, and  P  < 0.001). Posttherapy CD36+% had the best sensitivity of 100% and the best specificity of 95.45% (Figures  5(d) - 5(f) ).\nThe posttherapy IL-19 AUC was 0.993 (95% CI = 0.941-1.000,  P  < 0.001), with a cutoff >280 pg/mL for diagnosis of extranodal involvement. IL-19 showed 100% sensitivity and 97.73% specificity ( Figure 5(g) ).\n"], "ner": [[[64, 72, "DISEASE"], [219, 227, "DISEASE"], [421, 429, "DISEASE"], [766, 774, "DISEASE"], [907, 915, "DISEASE"],

Subjects\nThe study included 50 healthy individuals and 78 lymphoma patients. Normal controls included thirty-six males and fourteen females. Healthy volunteers ranged in age from 24 to 81 years old. Seventy-eight lymphoma subjects ranged in age from 11 to 81 years, including 39 males and 39 females. The criteria for all subjects are listed in (Supplementary Table  1 ).\nAfter therapy and follow-up, there were 34 lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement and 44 without extranodal involvement. Patients with extranodal involvement had a mean age of 42.81 \u00b1 7.6, ranging from 11 to 81, while those without extranodal involvement had a mean age of 42 \u00b1 16.1, ranging from 18 to 75. Supplementary Table  2  reveals no significant differences regarding age, lymphoma types, and subtypes between patients without extranodal involvement ( N  = 34) and patients with extranodal involvement ( N  = 34). Lymphoma patients with and without extranodal involvement revealed statistical significance regarding sex ( P  = 0.039), stage ( P  < 0.001), recurrence ( P  < 0.001), and death ( P  = 0.018). Among lymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement, 73.5% had a recurrence, and 20.6% died. 26.5% of patients with extranodal involvement presented with stage III diseases, while 58.8% had stage IV diseases. Only 2.9% of patients with extranodal involvement had stage I, and 11.8% had stage II (Supplementary Table  2 ).\nThe different extranodal involvement sites in lymphoma patients are shown in  Table 1 . Bone marrow involvement and lymph vessel infiltration were found in 33.3% and 21.8% of patients, respectively. 12.8% of patients presented with lung involvement, while approximately 10.3% had spleen infiltration. Furthermore, 9% of lymphoma patients showed liver involvement. Only 1.3% of patients had involvement of the intestine, thyroid, or central nervous system ( Table 1 ).\n3.2. High PD-L1/PD-1 Expression in Circulating CD36+ and CXCR3+ Lymphocytes in Newly Diagnosed Lymphoma Patients\nFlow cytometric analysis investigated CD36 and CXCR3 expression in peripheral lymphocytes in 78 newly diagnosed lymphoma patients and 50 healthy controls. Lymphocyte gating was shown in Supplementary Figures  1-4 . CD36 and CXCR3 positive lymphocytes were found in small percentages in healthy controls (median: 4.2% (range: 3.5-5.7) and median: 11.2% (range: 9.7-13.2)). High pretherapy CXCR3+% and CD36+% of cells were observed in lymphoma patients than in normal volunteers (median: 40% vs. 11.2%; 13% vs. 4.2%,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).\nThe study then examined whether peripheral CD36 and CXCR3 positive lymphocytes expressed PD-L1 and PD-1. Compared to healthy controls, newly diagnosed lymphoma patients had higher PD-L1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% (32% vs. 1.1%; 10% vs. 0.7%,  P  < 0.001). Interestingly, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% in newly diagnosed lymphoma subjects were significantly higher than in healthy volunteers (median: 8% vs. 1%; 5 vs. 0.2,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 2 ).\n3.3. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3+/CD36 Defines Extranodal Involvement in Lymphoma\nExtranodal involvement of lymphoma indicates an inferior prognosis for lymphoma. PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes was investigated in posttherapy lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement ( n  = 34) or without extranodal involvement ( n  = 44) ( Figure 1 ). Posttherapy 34 lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement were characterized by higher percentages of peripheral CXCR3 positive lymphocytes than those in posttherapy 44 patients without extranodal involvement (median: 78% vs. 26%,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ). When considering circulating CD36+ lymphocytes, CD36+% was lower in extranodal involvement compared with subjects without extranodal involvement (median: 27% vs. 55.5%,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 1 ).\nLymphoma subjects with extranodal involvement had higher PD-L1+CXCR3+% and PD-1+CXCR3+% compared with subjects without extranodal involvement (median 65% vs. 4%; 12.", "2% vs. 2%,  P  < 0.001, respectively) (Figures  1(a) - 1(d) ). Furthermore, PD-L1+CD36% and PD-1+CD36+% were significantly higher in subjects with extranodal involvement compared with patients without extranodal involvement (median 22 vs. 8,  P  = 0.004; 5.8% vs. 1%,  P  < 0.001) (Figures  1(e) - 1(h) ).\nA significant increase in posttherapy PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes was detected in the extranodal involvement group compared with the pretherapy samples of the same group (Supplementary Table  3 ). However, lymphoma patients without extranodal involvement had a lower posttherapy PDL-1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 than in the pretherapy samples of the same patients (Supplementary Table  4 ).\n3.4. IL-19 in Lymphoma Patients\nNewly diagnosed 78 lymphoma patients had significantly higher IL-19 levels than normal volunteers (median = 237 vs. 7.2 pg/mL,  P  < 0.001). Moreover, lymphoma patients had higher posttherapy IL-19 levels than the normal controls (median: 219 vs. 7,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(a) ).\nPosttherapy IL-19 levels were detected in lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement, and the median level was 628 pg/mL (range: 439-817.3), which was significantly higher than that of subjects without extranodal invasion with a median of 46.5 pg/mL (range: 33-137.5) ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(b) ). Interestingly, compared to patients without extranodal involvement, lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement had higher pretherapy IL-19 levels (median: 525 vs. 100,  P  < 0.001) ( Figure 2(b) ).\n3.5. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3+/CD36 and IL-19 Defines Lymphoma Clinical Outcome\nPatients with CR had significantly lower pretherapy IL-19, CXCR3+%, and PD-L1+CXCR3+% compared to the PR, recurrence, and refractory groups ( P  < 0.05). Furthermore, compared to the PR, recurrence, and refractory groups, the CR group had a significant reduction in posttherapy IL-19, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% ( P  < 0.05). Additionally, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% were significantly lower in subjects with CR compared to the other groups. Contrarily, comparing the CR group to the other groups, there was a substantial rise in posttherapy CD36+% ( P  < 0.001,  P  < 0.001, and  P  = 0.010) ( Table 3 ).\nThe CR group showed a significant reduction in pretherapy PD-1+CXCR3+% and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+% compared to the PR group and recurrence group ( P  < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed when subjects with CR were compared to the treatment-refractory patients ( P  = 0.092 and  P  = 0.055). In addition, the CR patients' PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+ % were significantly lower than those in the PR group ( P  = 0.037 and  P  = 0.002). However, no significant difference was detected between the CR group and the recurrence group or the refractory group ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 3 ).\nPretherapy IL-19 levels, CXCR3+%, and PD-L1+CXCR3+% in lymphoma patients with recurrence were statistically higher than in the PR patients ( P  < 0.001). Additionally, the recurrence group's posttherapy IL-19 levels, PD-L1+CXCR3+, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were significantly higher than those of PR patients ( P  = 0.018,  P  = 0.013, and  P  = 0.011) ( Table 3 ). Furthermore, pretherapy PD-1+CD36+% and posttherapy CD36+% in patients with recurrence were significantly lower than in PR patients ( P  = 0.022 and  P  = 0.002). However, no significant differences were observed when the treatment-refractory group compared to PR or recurrence groups ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 3 ).\n3.6. Correlation between PDL-1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36, IL-19, and Laboratory and Clinical Criteria\nThe results revealed a positive association between pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3%, and LDH ( r  = 0.344,  P  = 0.002;  r  = 0.375,  P  = 0.001;  r  = 0.315,  P  = 0.005, respectively). However, negative associations between CXCR3+%, PD-L1/PD-1+CXCR3%, and albumin levels were identified ( r  = -0.269;  P  = 0.017;  r  = -0.326,  P  = 0.", "004;  r  = -0.337,  P  = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, there was a negative association between PD-L1+CXCR3+% and hemoglobin ( r  = -0.254,  P  = 0.025) ( Table 4 ).\nCXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively correlated with hepatomegaly ( r  = 0.464,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.398,  P  < 0.001,  r  = 0.335,  P  = 0.003). Data revealed that CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% positively correlated with lymphoma stages ( r  = 0.498,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.437,  P  < 0.001,  r  = 0.333,  P  = 0.002) ( Table 4 ). Moreover, CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% associated positively with both splenomegaly ( r  = 0.348,  P  = 0.002;  r  = 0.268,  P  = 0.018) and general lymphadenopathy ( r  = 0.362,  P  = 0.001;  r  = 0.304,  P  = 0.007). Furthermore, CXCR3+% and PD-L1+CXCR3+% positively correlated with BCR-ABL ( r  = 0.262,  P  = 0.020;  r  = 0.271,  P  = 0.016). Additionally, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% had a significant association with lymphoma recurrence ( r  = 0.645,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.676,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.310,  P  = 0.006) ( Table 4 ). CD36+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CD36+% were associated with some of clinical parameters but without significance ( P  > 0.05) ( Table 4 ).\nInterestingly, pretherapy IL-19 was positively correlated with LDH levels ( r  = 0.349 and  P  = 0.002), hepatomegaly ( r  = 0.362 and  P  = 0.001), and splenomegaly ( r  = 0.231 and  P  = 0.042). Furthermore, pretherapy IL-19 levels were significantly associated with lymphedema, general lymphadenopathy, and recurrence ( r  = 0.426,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.239,  P  = 0.035;  r  = 0.641,  P  < 0.001) ( Table 4 ).\n3.7. Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 and CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 Is Associated with Extranodal Involvement\nPosttherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively associated with extranodal involvement ( r  = 0.771,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.793,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.528,  P  < 0.001). CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% had a positive association with bone marrow involvement ( r  = 0.645,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.676,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.369,  P  < 0.001). Moreover, CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% were positively associated with lymph vessel involvement ( r  = 0.499,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.487,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.272,  P  = 0.016). Additionally, a significant association between CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, PD-1+CXCR3+%, and lung involvement was identified ( r  = 0.277,  P  = 0.014;  r  = 0.286,  P  = 0.011;  r  = 0.235,  P  = 0.038) ( Table 5 ).\nPosttherapy PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-L1+CD36+% were positively correlated with extranodal involvement ( r  = 0.333,  P  = 0.003;  r  = 0.469,  P  < 0.001), while CD36+% had a negative association with extranodal involvement ( r  = -0.792 and  P  < 0.001). Of interest, PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% were positively correlated with bone marrow infiltration ( r  = 0.312,  P  = 0.005;  r  = 0.390,  P  < 0.001). PD-1+CD36+% was positively correlated with lung involvement ( r  = 0.234;  P  = 0.040). CD36% was negatively correlated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement ( r  = -0.633,  P  < 0.001;  r  = -0.386,  P  < 0.001). Furthermore, percentages of CD36+ lymphocytes were correlated with spleen infiltration ( r  = 0.327;  P  = 0.004) ( Table 5 ).\nIL-19 concentrations and extranodal involvement were positively correlated ( r  = 0.848;  P  < 0.001). IL-19 levels are positively associated with bone marrow and lymph vessel involvement ( r  = 0.637,  P  < 0.001;  r  = 0.437,  P  < 0.001). Similarly, a positive association between posttherapy IL-19 levels and lung involvement was identified ( r  = 0.278;  P  = 0.014) ( Table 5 ).\n3.8. Prognostic Value of PD-L1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19\nThe effect of the markers on EFS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier statistics ( Figure 3 ). Survival tree analysis identified that CXCR3+ and PD-L1+CXCR3+ staining percentages more than 50% were considered high, whereas those \u226450% were regarded as low staining. PD-1+CXCR3+ and PD-L1+CD36+ st", "aining percentages more than 7% were considered high, whereas those \u22647% were regarded as low staining.\nThere was a high reduction in EFS in lymphoma patients with high percentages of pre- and posttherapy CXCR3+ lymphocytes ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(a)  and  3(e) ). Moreover, pre- and posttherapy PD-L1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were negatively associated with EFS ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(b)  and  3(f) ). Patients' EFS was significantly decreased when their initial PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocyte percentages were high ( P  = 0.022) ( Figure 3(c) ). High pre-T IL-19 levels were associated with inferior EFS ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure 3(d) ). A prolonged EFS was predicted by low posttherapy PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-1+CD36+% ( P  < 0.001) (Figures  3(g)  and  3(h) ).\nThe effect of the immune markers on overall survival and recurrence-free survival was determined using Kaplan-Meier statistics (data not shown). Patients with low pre- and posttherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXC3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% do better than those with a high percentage. Furthermore, low PD-L1+CD36+% and PD-L1+CD36+% predicted a more prolonged survival and recurrence-free time.\n3.9. Diagnostic Utility of PD-L1/PD-1 Coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 in Identifying Extranodal Involvement\n\n Figure 4  shows the ROC analysis for predicting extranodal involvement in lymphoma. Pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% could predict extranodal involvement with AUCs of 0.982, 0.981, and 0.764 (95% CI = 0.922 - 0.999; 0.921-0.999; 0.654-0.853;  P  < 0.001, respectively) (Figures  4(a) - 4(c) ). Pretherapy CXCR3+%, PD-L1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXCR3+% cut-offs were >41, >33, and >11, respectively. Moreover, pretherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% sensitivities were 97.06%, 97.06%, and 61.67%, and the specificities were 97.73%, 97.73%, and 79.55%. Pretherapy CXCR3+% and PDL-1+CXCR3+ had the best sensitivity and specificity. Pretherapy IL-19 levels could predict extranodal involvement with an AUC of 0.909 (95% CI = 0.822 - 0.962,  P  < 0.001). The pretherapy IL-19 cut-off was >209 pg/mL, with specificity and sensitivity 75% and 91.18% ( Figure 4(d) ).\nPosttherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% could diagnose lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement. Posttherapy CXCR3+%, PDL-1+CXCR3+%, and PD-1+CXC3+% AUCs were 0.949, 0.961, and 0.805 ( P  < 0.001) at a cutoff >49, >40, and >3, respectively (Figures  5(a) - 5(c) ).

Healthy controls included thirty-six males and fourteen females. Healthy volunteers' range in age was from 26 to 70 years old. Seventy-eight lymphoma subjects ranged in age from 11 to 81 years, including 39 men and 39 women. Patients received treatment as soon as the primary diagnosis is confirmed. Patients with lymphoma were followed, and the patients were separated into two groups based on how well they responded to treatment: group I with no extranodal involvement and group II with extranodal involvement. Lymphoma patients' clinical outcomes were evaluated according to Cheson response criteria (National Cancer Institute Working Group standards for response to treatment) [ 46 ]. According to established criteria, the effectiveness of the treatment was assessed in 78 patients, of whom twenty-nine had a complete response (CR), eighteen had a partial response (PR), twenty-seven had a recurrence, and four had a treatment failure [ 46 ]. Pretherapy and posttherapy blood samples were taken to assess IL-19 levels and PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes for the presence of extranodal involvement and response to treatment. Patients with missing pathological or clinical information on their lymphoma were excluded from the study. Atherosclerosis, various cancers, and persistent infections were all ruled out. Each subject signed an informed consent form. This study was performed in the Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University.\n2.2. Clinical Data\nA complete clinical examination was performed on all subjects to monitor lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, and detailed history questionnaires were completed. To determine the performance, type, and stage of lymphoma, all patients underwent bone marrow aspiration and lymph node biopsy. The Ann Arbor classification has been considered for clinical staging [ 47 ]. The modified International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) 2018 criteria were used in diagnosis [ 48 ], and CLL stages were assessed according to the Rai staging system [ 49 ]. Three expert pathologists validated all pathological specimens following WHO criteria [ 50 ]. Using a flow cytometer, the patients' immunophenotyping was performed. All patients obtained chest X-rays and pelviabdominal ultrasounds to rule out extramedullary involvement. The patient's performance was evaluated according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale [ 51 ]. PET (positron emission tomography) or CT (computed tomography) scans were used. The Ann Arbor approach [ 52 ] was used to assess lymphoma staging. BCR-ABL, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR.\n2.3. Follow-Up and Lymphoma Therapy\nFollow-up for lymphoma patients was performed at the hematology clinic and by telephone. The posttherapy lymphoma status was evaluated in lymphoma patients by means of clinical examination and PET/CT scans. Patients will be evaluated every three months for the identification of lymphoma progression. The follow-up was only for 78 patients with lymphoma out of 92 patients. The follow-up could not be performed for these patients as some patients were referred to other centers, some have died, and some had rejected blood samples rewithdrawal. Event-free survival (EFS) measures the time between the end of therapy and the commencement of an event (extranodal involvement). Seven follicular cell lymphoma (FCL) and twenty-eight diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients' subjects had CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone) [ 53 ]. In contrast, those with HL had ABVD therapy (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and radiation [ 54 ]. Seven patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) underwent various treatments designed based on the therapy indications, stage, and comorbidities. The following strategies were used for CLL: no therapy (approach of watching and waiting if there is no therapy indication); corticosteroids (quiescent CLL with immune cytopenias); FCR chemotherapy (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) was indicated for CLL progressive illness [ 49 ]. One marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) patient and two mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma patients had chemotherapy, rituximab, and radiotherapy.\n2.4. Blood Sampling\nAll subjects provided peripheral samples, which were taken under very sterile conditions. Eight milliliters of blood were collected. For a complete blood count (CBC), 2 mL of blood was put into an EDTA tube. For flow cytometric analysis, 2 mL of blood was inserted into an EDTA tube. A plain tube was filled with 4 mL of blood, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. Serum was isolated and used to analyze liver function tests (bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), kidney function tests (serum creatinine and blood urea), and random blood sugar. The leftover serum was kept at -70\u00b0C until the serum IL-19 concentrations were measured.\n2.5. Laboratory Investigations\nA computerized hematology analyzer was used to determine CBC (Celtac G, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Japan). Renal function analysis (blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine), liver function analysis (ALT, AST, bilirubin, and albumin), and random blood sugar were performed using an autoanalyzer (SELECTRA, ELITech Group, clinical chemistry automation systems, France). An automated ACE chemistry analyzer assessed LDH (Schiapparelli Biosystems. INC; USA).\n2.6. Immunophenotyping\nPD-1/PD-L1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 was determined in collected blood samples. To identify the various immune cells, the following human monoclonal antibodies were used, as directed by the manufacturer: PD-1 (BioLegend, catalog No. 329906), CXCR3 monoclonal antibody (BioLegend; catalog no. 353704), PD-L1 (BioLegend, catalog No. 309706), and CD36 monoclonal antibody (BioLegend, catalog No. 336204). Unstained cells were utilized as a negative control for every patient. Negative isotypic controls were performed using other tubes. As isotype controls, monoclonal PE-conjugated IgG2a (BioLegend; catalog no. 402203) and FITC IgG1 were used (BioLegend; catalog no. 400110).\n2.7. Staining Flow Cytometric Analysis\nThe percentages of PD-L1+CXCR3+, PD-1+CXCR3, PD-L1+CD36+, and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes were calculated using flow cytometry BD FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson, CA, San Diego, USA). In brief, a hundred microliters of anticoagulated-EDTA whole blood were stained with five uL of monoclonal antibodies and incubated at room temperature in the dark for twenty minutes. The cells were lysed using the lysing buffer and set aside for about ten minutes at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then washed two times with PBS and resuspended in 300 uL of PBS solution. A minimum of 10,000 events were analyzed. Lymphocyte gating was carried out through the FSC/SSC plots (front scatter vs. side scatter technique) [ 55 - 60 ], and then, CXCR3+ and CD36+ lymphocytes were gated for PDL1/PD-1 expression [ 61 - 65 ]. The cutoff values were calculated using the isotypic controls as a guide. Unstained cells were employed as a negative control for every patient.\n2.8. ELISA for IL-19 Analysis\nThe concentrations of IL-19 in serum were assessed using an ELISA kit (Sunred Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai) following the manufacturer's instructions. In the 96 wells of the microtiter strips, a specific monoclonal for IL-19 was coated (sensitivity for IL-19: 1.3 pg/mL). A microtiter plate reader was used to determine optical densities at 450 nm.\n2.9. Statistical Analyses\nThe data were analyzed by applying the SPSS application (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 25. Normally, quantitative data was analyzed by minimum and maximum range and mean and standard deviation (SD). The median and interquartile range (IQR) was utilized for quantitative nonparametric data, while percentage and number were employed for categorical data. Mann-Whitney analysis was carried out to analyze quantitative nonparametric data between two groups. Kruskal-Wallis test was carried out to analyze nonparametric data between more than two groups, proceeded by pairwise comparisons between each two groups applying Bonferroni correction. Fisher's exact test, or the Chi-square test, was carried out to compare the qualitative data between groups. Association between continuous and qualitative ordinal variables was assessed by Spearman's correlation, while Pearson's correlation was performed for the association between 2 continuous variables.\nThe Kaplan-Meier analysis was carried out to assess EFS, comparing the survival curves using the log-rank test. The variables' cutoff point, area under the curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity were calculated using the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.  P  values less than 0.05 were considered significant.\n"], "ner": [[[29, 37, "DISEASE"], [241, 249, "DISEASE"], [414, 422, "DISEASE"], [614, 622, "DISEASE"], [1111, 1116, "GENE"], [1128, 1133, "GENE"], [1134, 1138, "GENE"], [1157, 1162, "GENE"], [1163, 1167, "GENE"], [1332, 1340, "DISEASE"], [1371, 1386, "DISEASE"], [1396, 1402, "DISEASE"], [1832, 1840, "DISEASE"], [2660, 2668, "DISEASE"], [2776, 2784, "DISEASE"], [2807, 2815, "DISEASE"], [2898, 2906, "DISEASE"], [2931, 2939, "DISEASE"], [3072, 3080, "DISEASE"], [3138, 3146, "DISEASE"], [3490, 3498, "DISEASE"], [3522, 3551, "DISEASE"], [3553, 3558, "DISEASE"], [3809, 3837, "DISEASE"], [3839, 3842, "DISEASE"], [3981, 3984, "DISEASE"]], [[4094, 4097, "DISEASE"], [4205, 4208, "DISEASE"], [4241, 4263, "DISEASE"], [4265, 4268, "DISEASE"], [4327, 4335, "DISEASE"], [5644, 5648, "GENE"], [5649, 5654, "GENE"], [5673, 5678, "GENE"], [5679, 5683, "GENE"], [5851, 5855, "GENE"], [5889, 5894, "GENE"], [5948, 5953, "GENE"], [5991, 5995, "GENE"], [6380, 6385, "GENE"], [6386, 6391, "GENE"], [6394, 6398, "GENE"], [6399, 6404, "GENE"], [6406, 6411, "GENE"], [6412, 6416, "GENE"], [6423, 6427, "GENE"], [6428, 6432, "GENE"], [7090, 7095, "GENE"], [7101, 7105, "GENE"], [7134, 7138, "GENE"], [7139, 7143, "GENE"]], []], "relations": [[], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2], "sentences": ["\n2.1.

PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in peripheral lymphocytes in lymphoma still needs to be clarified. The current study investigated PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes, serum IL-19 levels, and their correlation with clinical outcome and extranodal involvement in lymphoma.  Subjects and Methods . The coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3/CD36 on circulating lymphocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry in 78 lymphoma patients before and after therapy and in 50 healthy controls. The concentration levels of IL-19 in serum were assessed by an ELISA.  Results . PD-L1 and PD-1 were expressed on circulating CXCR3+ and CD36+ lymphocytes in lymphoma and were significantly higher in patients with extranodal involvement than in lymphoma patients without extranodal involvement ( P  < 0.001). Elevated IL-19 levels were observed in lymphoma patients and increased significantly in extranodal involvement ( P  < 0.001). High percentages of PD-L1+CXCR3+ and PD-1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes were associated with high LDH levels, hepatomegaly, lymphedema, advanced tumor stage, and recurrence. Furthermore, patients with splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy had high percentages of PD-L1+CXCR3+ lymphocytes. In addition, levels of PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3 and IL-19 were significantly associated with bone marrow, lung, and lymph vessel involvement. Further analysis revealed that high percentages of PD-L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes were associated with lung and bone marrow involvement. Patients with high levels of PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3 and IL-19 had inferior event-free survival (EFS) compared with that in lymphoma patients with low levels. EFS was decreased in patients with high percentages of PD-L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes. When using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the superiority of IL-19 (area under the curve (AUC): 0.993) and PD-L1+CXCR3+% (AUC: 0.961) to PD-1+CXCR3+% (AUC: 0.805), PD-L1+CD36+% (AUC: 0.694), and PD-1+CD36+% (AUC 0.769) was evident in the diagnosis of extranodal involvement, identifying lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement from patients without extranodal involvement.  Conclusions . Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes and serum IL-19 levels contributes to poor prognosis and might be potential markers for extranodal involvement in lymphoma.\n"], "ner": [[[24, 29, "GENE"], [30, 34, "GENE"], [40, 45, "GENE"], [46, 50, "GENE"], [55, 60, "GENE"], [84, 92, "DISEASE"], [140, 145, "GENE"], [146, 150, "GENE"], [203, 208, "GENE"], [209, 213, "GENE"], [232, 237, "GENE"], [238, 242, "GENE"], [272, 280, "DISEASE"], [341, 346, "GENE"], [347, 351, "GENE"], [370, 375, "GENE"], [376, 380, "GENE"], [415, 420, "GENE"], [503, 511, "DISEASE"], [557, 562, "GENE"], [563, 567, "GENE"], [573, 578, "GENE"], [579, 583, "GENE"], [648, 656, "DISEASE"], [747, 752, "GENE"], [800, 805, "GENE"], [810, 814, "GENE"], [845, 850, "GENE"], [856, 860, "GENE"], [964, 972, "DISEASE"], [1037, 1042, "GENE"], [1067, 1075, "DISEASE"], [1174, 1179, "GENE"], [1180, 1185, "GENE"], [1191, 1195, "GENE"], [1196, 1201, "GENE"], [1412, 1418, "GENE"], [1419, 1424, "GENE"], [1462, 1467, "GENE"], [1468, 1472, "GENE"], [1491, 1496, "GENE"], [1501, 1506, "GENE"], [1642, 1647, "GENE"], [1648, 1652, "GENE"], [1658, 1662, "GENE"], [1663, 1667, "GENE"], [1765, 1770, "GENE"], [1771, 1775, "GENE"], [1794, 1799, "GENE"], [1804, 1809, "GENE"], [1871, 1879, "DISEASE"], [1961, 1966, "GENE"], [1967, 1971, "GENE"], [1977, 1981, "GENE"], [1982, 1986, "GENE"], [2082, 2087, "GENE"], [2128, 2133, "GENE"], [2134, 2139, "GENE"], [2158, 2162, "GENE"], [2163, 2168, "GENE"], [2185, 2190, "GENE"], [2191, 2195, "GENE"], [2216, 2220, "GENE"], [2221, 2225, "GENE"], [2308, 2316, "DISEASE"], [2431, 2436, "GENE"], [2437, 2441, "GENE"], [2447, 2452, "GENE"], [2453, 2457, "GENE"], [2495, 2500, "GENE"], [2523, 2537, "RELATION"], [2599, 2607, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[2431, 2436, 2599, 2607, "negative prognostic marker"], [2437, 2441, 2599, 2607, "negative prognostic marker"], [2447, 2452, 2599, 2607, "negative prognostic marker"], [2453, 2457, 2599, 2607, "negative prognostic marker"], [2495, 2500, 2599, 2607, "negative prognostic marker"]]], "triplets": [[[2431, 2436, 2599, 2607, 2523, 2537], [2437, 2441, 2599, 2607, 2523, 2537], [2453, 2457, 2599, 2607, 2523, 2537], [2447, 2452, 2599, 2607, 2523, 2537], [2495, 2500, 2599, 2607, 2523, 2537]]], "triplets_text": [[["PD - L1", "lymphoma", "poor prognosis"], ["PD - 1", "lymphoma", "poor prognosis"], ["CD36", "lymphoma", "poor prognosis"], ["CXCR3", "lymphoma", "poor prognosis"], ["IL - 19", "lymphoma", "poor prognosis"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0], "sentences": ["\nTitle: Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3/CD36 and IL-19 Increase in Extranodal Lymphoma.\nAbstract: Many studies have demonstrated that PD-L1/PD-1 signaling is an immune evasion mechanism in tumors.

Further analysis revealed that high percentages of PD-L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes were associated with lung and bone marrow involvement. Patients with high levels of PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3 and IL-19 had inferior event-free survival (EFS) compared with that in lymphoma patients with low levels. EFS was decreased in patients with high percentages of PD-L1+CD36+ and PD-1+CD36+ lymphocytes. When using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the superiority of IL-19 (area under the curve (AUC): 0.993) and PD-L1+CXCR3+% (AUC: 0.961) to PD-1+CXCR3+% (AUC: 0.805), PD-L1+CD36+% (AUC: 0.694), and PD-1+CD36+% (AUC 0.769) was evident in the diagnosis of extranodal involvement, identifying lymphoma patients with extranodal involvement from patients without extranodal involvement.  Conclusions . Coexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating lymphocytes and serum IL-19 levels contributes to poor prognosis and might be potential markers for extranodal involvement in lymphoma.\n"]}
{"doc_key": "9886470_1. Introduction", "text": ["\nLymphomas are heterogeneous hematological malignancies arising in the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial systems. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are the two forms of lymphoma [ 1 ,  2 ]. Both HL and NHL can impact any organ or tissue in the body. Extranodal lymphoma describes the lymphomatous invasion of tissues other than lymphoid organs or lymph nodes. The most commonly affected organs by lymphomatous infiltration are the lung, liver, bone, stomach, skin, spleen, central nervous system, and Waldeyer's ring [ 3 - 6 ]. Depending on the lymphoma stage and the histological type, the distribution and prevalence of the affected organs var y  [ 7 ,  8 ]. The incidence of extranodal involvement is increasing. The most significant challenges in lymphoma therapy are recurrence and extranodal involvement [ 9 ].\nT cells express the regulatory inhibitory protein programmed death-1 (PD-1), a transmembrane element [ 10 ]. Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, regulatory cells, and tumor cells express PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) [ 11 ]. PD-L1/PD-1 transmits restraining signals to T cells in lymphomas, causing functional exhaustion, anergy, or lymphocyte apoptosis [ 12 ,  13 ]. Previous studies reported overexpression of PD-L1/PD-1 in HL and various forms of NHL [ 14 ,  15 ]. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between PD-L1/PD-1 and extranodal involvement in lymphoma. PD-L1/PD-1 antibodies have launched a new era of lymphoma immunotherapy [ 16 ].\nCXCR3, a G protein-coupled cell surface receptor (GPCR), is present on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes surface and other cells, like epithelial cells [ 17 ]. Still, interestingly, FOXp3+ regulatory T cells express it (Tregs) [ 18 - 20 ]. CXCR3 expression is upregulated in lymphoma [ 21 ,  22 ]. CXCR3 expression initiates tumor cell survival and metastasis through CXCR3 ligand expression [ 23 - 25 ].\nCluster differentiation 36 (CD36) is a scavenger receptor on the surface of monocytes, adipocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes [ 26 - 33 ]. CD36 can bind to many ligands, including fatty acids, thrombospondin 1, and apoptotic cells [ 34 ]. CD36 functions include molecular adhesion, apoptosis, immune identification, and lipid uptake [ 35 - 37 ]. CD36 expression is associated with tumor cell growth and metastases [ 38 ,  39 ]. In an orthotopic OSCC mouse model, Pascual et al. showed that the suppression of CD36 prevented lymph node metastasis, demonstrating the necessity of fatty acids and CD36 for lymph node metastasis [ 34 ].\nInterleukin-19 (IL-19) is a member of the IL-10 family [ 40 ]. Essential sources of IL-19 are macrophages, monocytes, B lymphocytes, epithelial, and endothelial cells [ 41 ]. High serum IL-19 levels have been detected in patients with NHL [ 42 ]. High IL-19 levels are associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and advanced tumor stages [ 43 ,  44 ].\nTumors have developed various strategies, disrupting \"immune checkpoints\" to get through the host's immune system [ 45 ]. The study assessed PD-L1/PD-1 coexpression with CXCR3/CD36 in circulating CXCR3 and CD36 positive lymphocytes and serum IL-19 levels in extranodal lymphoma. Furthermore, the study investigated the effect of this coexpression and IL-19 on lymphoma prognosis. This study could help uncover new mechanistic insights into the extranodal involvement of lymphoma and assess a new era of lymphoma immunotherapy.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 9, "DISEASE"], [114, 130, "DISEASE"], [132, 134, "DISEASE"], [140, 160, "DISEASE"], [162, 165, "DISEASE"], [188, 196, "DISEASE"], [214, 216, "DISEASE"], [221, 224, "DISEASE"], [564, 572, "DISEASE"], [770, 778, "DISEASE"], [886, 904, "GENE"], [906, 910, "GENE"], [1030, 1041, "GENE"], [1043, 1048, "GENE"], [1058, 1063, "GENE"], [1064, 1068, "GENE"], [1113, 1121, "DISEASE"], [1227, 1241, "RELATION"], [1245, 1250, "GENE"], [1251, 1255, "GENE"], [1259, 1261, "DISEASE"], [1283, 1286, "DISEASE"], [1365, 1370, "GENE"], [1371, 1375, "GENE"], [1406, 1414, "DISEASE"], [1416, 1421, "GENE"], [1422, 1426, "GENE"], [1465, 1473, "DISEASE"], [1474, 1487, "RELATION"], [1496, 1501, "GENE"], [1567, 1570, "GENE"], [1576, 1579, "GENE"], [1670, 1675, "GENE"], [1728, 1733, "GENE"], [1734, 1759, "RELATION"], [1763, 1771, "DISEASE"], [1786, 1791, "GENE"], [1856, 1861, "GENE"], [1893, 1919, "GENE"], [1921, 1925, "GENE"], [2051, 2055, "GENE"], [2151, 2155, "GENE"], [2258, 2262, "GENE"], [2421, 2425, "GENE"], [2506, 2510, "GENE"], [2545, 2559, "GENE"], [2561, 2566, "GENE"], [2587, 2592, "GENE"], [[2720, 2737], [2730, 2743], "RELATION"], [2731, 2736, "GENE"], [2780, 2783, "DISEASE"], [2797, 2802, "GENE"], [3039, 3044, "GENE"], [3045, 3049, "GENE"], [3068, 3073, "GENE"], [[3074, 3078], [3078, 3079], "GENE"], [3094, 3099, "GENE"], [3104, 3108, "GENE"], [3140, 3145, "GENE"], [3167, 3175, "DISEASE"], [3249, 3254, "GENE"], [3258, 3266, "DISEASE"], [3368, 3376, "DISEASE"], [3401, 3409, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[1245, 1250, 1259, 1261, "increased expression"], [1245, 1250, 1283, 1286, "increased expression"], [1251, 1255, 1259, 1261, "increased expression"], [1251, 1255, 1283, 1286, "increased expression"], [1416, 1421, 1465, 1473, "therapeutic target"], [1422, 1426, 1465, 1473, "therapeutic target"], [1728, 1733, 1763, 1771, "increased expression"], [2731, 2736, 2780, 2783, "increased expression"]]], "triplets": [[[1245, 1250, 1259, 1261, 1227, 1241], [1245, 1250, 1283, 1286, 1227, 1241], [1251, 1255, 1259, 1261, 1227, 1241], [1251, 1255, 1283, 1286, 1227, 1241], [1416, 1421, 1465, 1473, 1474, 1487], [1422, 1426, 1465, 1473, 1474, 1487], [1728, 1733, 1763, 1771, 1734, 1759], [2731, 2736, 2780, 2783, [2720, 2737], [2730, 2743]]]], "triplets_text": [[["PD - L1", "HL", "overexpression"], ["PD - L1", "NHL", "overexpression"], ["PD - 1", "HL", "overexpression"], ["PD - 1", "NHL", "overexpression"], ["PD - L1", "lymphoma", "immunotherapy"], ["PD - 1", "lymphoma", "immunotherapy"], ["CXCR3", "lymphoma", "expression is upregulated"], ["IL - 19", "NHL", "High serum levels"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0], "sentences": ["\nLymphomas are heterogeneous hematological malignancies arising in the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial systems.

{"doc_key": "9416477_2. Materials and Methods", "text": ["\n2.1. Case Presentation\nThe timing of the clinical presentation of the present case is shown in  Figure 1 A.\nA 17-year-old female was incidentally diagnosed in 2012 with a 2.7 cm left adrenal mass suggestive of adenoma. The patient came to our attention in 2014. The lesion had increased to 3.6 cm in size. Urine tests showed high levels of urinary Metanephrine (MNu: 488 mcg/day, normal value (nv) < 320) and urinary Normetanephrine (NMNu: 65,125 mcg/day, nv < 390), indicating Pheo. No alteration in urinary Methoxytyramine levels (MTXu: nv < 460) and blood count were observed (white blood cells 6.28 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L normal value (nv) 4.00-11.00, red blood cells 5.09 \u00d7 10 6 /\u00b5L normal value (nv) 3.8-5.00, hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL nv 12.0-16.0, hematocrit 43.4% nv 35.0-48.8, platelets 287 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L normal value (nv) 150-450).\nThe patient was subjected to left laparoscopic adrenalectomy in June 2014 and the post-operative course was uneventful. Histologic examination revealed Pheo ( Figure 2 A). There was no evidence of capsular or vascular invasion and necrosis. The mitotic count was lower than 3 per 10 high-power fields (HPFs) and atypical figures were not seen. A  Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal Gland Scaled Score  (PASS) of 3 was assigned and the Ki67 proliferation index was <1%. A para-aortic lymph node was positive for the presence of chromaffin tissue ( Figure 2 B) and metastatic Pheo was diagnosed.\nPost-operative urinary metanephrine levels remained high (MNu 51 mcg/day, NMNu 882 mcg/day, and MTXu 116 mcg/day). Subsequent controls revealed an increase in NMNu up to 1346 mcg/day in October 2015 with a negative CT scan and MRI. The patient underwent  18 F-fluoro-dihydroxy-pheylalanine ( 18 F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) and  68 Ga-DOTATATE ( Figure 3 A) that revealed an increased uptake of para-aortic and retrocrural lymph nodes. The disease remained stable with a progressive increase in urinary NMN levels up to 2391 mcg/day. In June 2020, on account of the tumor burden and increasing levels of urinary NMN, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with  177 Lu-DOTATATE was initiated after egg preservation. PRRT was interrupted after four cycles due to a rapid increase in platelets (up to 2348 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L, nv 150-450). In January 2021, 68 Ga-DOTATATE showed a reduced tracer uptake ( Figure 3 B). Further investigations, including bone marrow biopsy and genetic analysis, were carried out. A standard karyotype identified the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR/Abl), the hallmark of CML, and therapy with Imatinib was prescribed (200 mg bid). The erythropoietin level rose mildly (34.7 mlU/mL, the normal value being 4.3-29). During therapy, red blood cell count and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels remained stable, and the last control resulted 3.70 \u00d7 10 6 /\u03bcL, 37%, and 12.2 g/dL, respectively. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and ferritin were normal (85.3 fl, 28.5 pg and 13 ng/mL, respectively).\n2.2. Genetic Analysis\nGenomic and tumor DNA of the patient were extracted using the QIAsymphony CDN kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA quality and quantity were measured by Qubit ds HS Assay on Qubit 2.0 Fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\nAccording to the guidelines for genetic screening of PPGL, our patient was proposed for NGS targeting. Using the online DesignStudio software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), probes were designed to cover the following genes:  PHD2  ( EGLN1 ),  EPAS1 ,  FH ,  KIF1B beta,  MAX ,  NF1 ,  RET ,  SDHA ,  SDHAF2 ,  SDHB ,  SDHC ,  SDHD ,  TMEM127 , and  VHL , including exon-intron boundaries.\n2.3. SNP-CGH Array\nTo exclude the presence of pathogenic Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor samples, Illumina Infinium 850k Bead Chip CGH/SNP Microarray was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n2.4. Whole Exome Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis\nWe decided to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) on blood and tumor DNA to sequence all coding genes in order to detect other variants in genes not included in our panel.\nTo construct DNA libraries, we used a strategy based on enzymatic fragmentation to produce dsDNA fragments followed by end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation and library amplification (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Libraries were hybridized with the protocol SeqCap EZ Exome v3 (Nimblegen, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and sequenced by NextSeQ550 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\n2.5. 3 D Variant Prediction\nTo reveal the possible structural consequences of the identified variant, a 3D model of the truncated PHD2 protein was generated using the Phyre2 (Protein Homology Fold Recognition Engine) server created by the Structural Bioinformatics Group, Imperial College, London. Phyre2 uses the alignment of hidden Markov models via an HH search-an open-source software program for protein sequence searching-to significantly improve alignment accuracy ( http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index , accessed on 13 June 2022) [ 36 ]. This was followed by I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement- https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/ , accessed on 13 August 2022) [ 37 ] to evaluate function the predictions and possible interactions of truncated PHD2 protein with other proteins and GRAMM v1.03, a program for protein docking to predict the structure of possible complexes ( http://vakser.compbio.ku.edu/resources/gramm/grammx/ , accessed on 13 August 2022) [ 38 , 39 ]. The generated *.pdb files were loaded and visualized with ChemDraw software to envisage a 3D structure (version 8; Cambridge Software; PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).\n2.6. PHD2 Immunohistochemistry\nPHD2 expression was assessed by probing formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections with mouse monoclonal antibody anti-PHD2 at 10 \u00b5g/mL (Abcam Cat#ab103432, RRID: AB_10710680). This antibody specifically recognizes a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-24 of human PHD2 and is therefore capable of recognizing both the  wild-type  ( wt)  protein and the mutant/truncated form. Antigen retrieval was achieved using Epitope Retrieval Solution Citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in a thermostatic bath. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using EnVision FLEX Systems and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen in a Dako Autostainer Link48 Instrument (Dako). Negative controls were incubated without the primary antibody. The sections were lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted with Permount.\n2.7. Western Blot Analysis\nDissected tumor tissues or human healthy adrenal samples (100 mg) were chopped in lysis buffer, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7  g  for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Proteins were quantified by Coomassie Blue-reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) [ 40 ] and 40 \u03bcg of proteins was separated by SDS/PAGE then transferred onto PVDF (Immobilon, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), as previously described [ 41 ]. Bound antibodies detected by ECL reagents (Immobilon, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) were analyzed with a Biorad ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Quantity-One Software). HIF2\u03b1 polyclonal antibody was supplied by Novus Biologicals (Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA), while anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody and anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\n2.8. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR\nFive different sample tissues obtained from pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and two from paraganglioma (PGL) were lysed for mRNA extraction. mRNA was isolated from frozen tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as previously described [ 42 , 43 ].\nFor each RNA sample, cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription PCR starting from 250 ng of RNA in 50 \u03bcL final volume reaction (Taqman RT-PCR kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) through the following cycling conditions: 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, 30 min at 48 \u00b0C, 3 min at 95 \u00b0C, and then held at 4 \u00b0C. Further quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using primers and probes from Applied Biosystems for the gene transcripts human  PHD2  (Hs00254392_m1) and  GAPDH  (4352934). RT-PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each gene on an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The number of target genes, normalized to the endogenous reference gene (human  GAPDH ) and relative to a calibrator (Stratagene, San Diego, CA, USA), was calculated by 2 -DeltaDeltaCt .\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient and the manuscript was written following the CARE guidelines.\n"], "ner": [[[211, 218, "DISEASE"], [479, 483, "DISEASE"], [976, 980, "DISEASE"], [1171, 1187, "DISEASE"], [1256, 1260, "GENE"], [1395, 1399, "DISEASE"], [3472, 3476, "GENE"], [3480, 3485, "GENE"], [3490, 3495, "GENE"], [3499, 3501, "GENE"], [3505, 3510, "GENE"], [3518, 3521, "GENE"], [3525, 3528, "GENE"], [3532, 3535, "GENE"], [3539, 3543, "GENE"], [3547, 3553, "GENE"], [3557, 3561, "GENE"], [3565, 3569, "GENE"], [3573, 3577, "GENE"], [3581, 3588, "GENE"], [3596, 3599, "GENE"]], [[5314, 5318, "GENE"], [5717, 5721, "GENE"], [5743, 5747, "GENE"], [5872, 5876, "GENE"], [6031, 6035, "GENE"], [7217, 7222, "GENE"], [7324, 7329, "GENE"], [7591, 7607, "DISEASE"], [7609, 7613, "DISEASE"], [7628, 7641, "DISEASE"], [7643, 7646, "DISEASE"]], [[8253, 8257, "GENE"], [8280, 8285, "GENE"], [8499, 8504, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2], "sentences": ["\n2.1.

In June 2020, on account of the tumor burden and increasing levels of urinary NMN, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with  177 Lu-DOTATATE was initiated after egg preservation. PRRT was interrupted after four cycles due to a rapid increase in platelets (up to 2348 \u00d7 10 3 /\u00b5L, nv 150-450). In January 2021, 68 Ga-DOTATATE showed a reduced tracer uptake ( Figure 3 B). Further investigations, including bone marrow biopsy and genetic analysis, were carried out. A standard karyotype identified the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (BCR/Abl), the hallmark of CML, and therapy with Imatinib was prescribed (200 mg bid). The erythropoietin level rose mildly (34.7 mlU/mL, the normal value being 4.3-29). During therapy, red blood cell count and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels remained stable, and the last control resulted 3.70 \u00d7 10 6 /\u03bcL, 37%, and 12.2 g/dL, respectively. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and ferritin were normal (85.3 fl, 28.5 pg and 13 ng/mL, respectively).\n2.2. Genetic Analysis\nGenomic and tumor DNA of the patient were extracted using the QIAsymphony CDN kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA quality and quantity were measured by Qubit ds HS Assay on Qubit 2.0 Fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\nAccording to the guidelines for genetic screening of PPGL, our patient was proposed for NGS targeting. Using the online DesignStudio software (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), probes were designed to cover the following genes:  PHD2  ( EGLN1 ),  EPAS1 ,  FH ,  KIF1B beta,  MAX ,  NF1 ,  RET ,  SDHA ,  SDHAF2 ,  SDHB ,  SDHC ,  SDHD ,  TMEM127 , and  VHL , including exon-intron boundaries.\n2.3. SNP-CGH Array\nTo exclude the presence of pathogenic Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor samples, Illumina Infinium 850k Bead Chip CGH/SNP Microarray was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n2.4.", " Whole Exome Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis\nWe decided to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) on blood and tumor DNA to sequence all coding genes in order to detect other variants in genes not included in our panel.\nTo construct DNA libraries, we used a strategy based on enzymatic fragmentation to produce dsDNA fragments followed by end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation and library amplification (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Libraries were hybridized with the protocol SeqCap EZ Exome v3 (Nimblegen, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and sequenced by NextSeQ550 platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\n2.5. 3 D Variant Prediction\nTo reveal the possible structural consequences of the identified variant, a 3D model of the truncated PHD2 protein was generated using the Phyre2 (Protein Homology Fold Recognition Engine) server created by the Structural Bioinformatics Group, Imperial College, London. Phyre2 uses the alignment of hidden Markov models via an HH search-an open-source software program for protein sequence searching-to significantly improve alignment accuracy ( http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index , accessed on 13 June 2022) [ 36 ]. This was followed by I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement- https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/ , accessed on 13 August 2022) [ 37 ] to evaluate function the predictions and possible interactions of truncated PHD2 protein with other proteins and GRAMM v1.03, a program for protein docking to predict the structure of possible complexes ( http://vakser.compbio.ku.edu/resources/gramm/grammx/ , accessed on 13 August 2022) [ 38 , 39 ]. The generated *.pdb files were loaded and visualized with ChemDraw software to envisage a 3D structure (version 8; Cambridge Software; PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).\n2.6. PHD2 Immunohistochemistry\nPHD2 expression was assessed by probing formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections with mouse monoclonal antibody anti-PHD2 at 10 \u00b5g/mL (Abcam Cat#ab103432, RRID: AB_10710680). This antibody specifically recognizes a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-24 of human PHD2 and is therefore capable of recognizing both the  wild-type  ( wt)  protein and the mutant/truncated form. Antigen retrieval was achieved using Epitope Retrieval Solution Citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in a thermostatic bath. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using EnVision FLEX Systems and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen in a Dako Autostainer Link48 Instrument (Dako). Negative controls were incubated without the primary antibody. The sections were lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted with Permount.\n2.7. Western Blot Analysis\nDissected tumor tissues or human healthy adrenal samples (100 mg) were chopped in lysis buffer, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7  g  for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Proteins were quantified by Coomassie Blue-reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) [ 40 ] and 40 \u03bcg of proteins was separated by SDS/PAGE then transferred onto PVDF (Immobilon, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), as previously described [ 41 ]. Bound antibodies detected by ECL reagents (Immobilon, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) were analyzed with a Biorad ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Quantity-One Software). HIF2\u03b1 polyclonal antibody was supplied by Novus Biologicals (Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA), while anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody and anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\n2.8. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR\nFive different sample tissues obtained from pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and two from paraganglioma (PGL) were lysed for mRNA extraction. mRNA was isolated from frozen tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), as previously described [ 42 , 43 ].", "\nFor each RNA sample, cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription PCR starting from 250 ng of RNA in 50 \u03bcL final volume reaction (Taqman RT-PCR kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) through the following cycling conditions: 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, 30 min at 48 \u00b0C, 3 min at 95 \u00b0C, and then held at 4 \u00b0C. Further quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out using primers and probes from Applied Biosystems for the gene transcripts human  PHD2  (Hs00254392_m1) and  GAPDH  (4352934). RT-PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each gene on an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The number of target genes, normalized to the endogenous reference gene (human  GAPDH ) and relative to a calibrator (Stratagene, San Diego, CA, USA), was calculated by 2 -DeltaDeltaCt .\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient and the manuscript was written following the CARE guidelines.\n"]}
{"doc_key": "9416477_4. Discussion", "text": ["\nHere, we describe a novel nonsense  PHD2  germline variant in a patient affected by metastatic Pheo and CML with no evidence of polycythemia.\nThe first case of a  PHD2  missense variant observed in a 30-year-old patient with polycythemia and abdominal PGL was reported in 2008 [ 34 ]. In 2014, a novel  PHD2  germline missense variant was detected in a patient affected by Pheo [ 45 ]. More recently, a novel  PHD2  germline missense variant was found in a patient with PPGL and polycythemia [ 35 ]. None of these patients presented metastatic disease.\nIn contrast, nonsense variants in the  PHD2  gene were exclusively described in patients over 35 years of age suffering from polycythemia without chromaffin diseases [ 46 , 47 ]. We cannot exclude that in our case the absence of polycythemia could be explained by the younger age of the patient.\nThe  PHD2  variants so far described in association with polycythemia are all heterozygous [ 48 ], suggesting that a partial loss of PHD2 activity is sufficient to induce polycythemia. Although only a few of the  PHD2  variants have been reported, including those associated with tumors other than Pheo, a larger number of patients are needed to understand the exact function of heterozygous variants.\nThe  PHD2  gene encodes prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein-2 (PHD2), catalyzing the post-translational modification of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors that play an essential role in oxygen homeostasis. Prolyl hydroxylation is a basic regulatory event that targets HIF subunits for proteasomal demolition via the Von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitylation complex [ 47 ]. At the physiological oxygen level (normoxia), PHD hydroxylates proline residues on HIF-\u03b1 subunits leading to their destabilization by promoting ubiquitination via the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In hypoxia, the O 2 -dependent hydroxylation of HIF-\u03b1 subunits by PHD is reduced, resulting in HIF-\u03b1 accumulation, dimerization with HIF-beta, and migration into the nucleus to induce an adaptive transcriptional response. Variants in the  PHD2  gene determine a pseudohypoxia status. Indeed, PHD2 is unable to hydroxylate HIF-\u03b1, with the consequent stabilization of HIF-\u03b1 subunits which are recognized as contributing to the pathogenesis of hereditary PPGLs [ 48 ].\nAs expected, our patient showed a lower expression of PHD2 and higher levels of HIF2\u03b1 compared to the healthy adrenal tissues, confirming that PHD2 down-regulation results in HIF2\u03b1 stabilization [ 49 ].\nIn our patient, we identified the new variant (c.153G>A) in the  PHD2  gene that introduces a stop codon, resulting in the production of a truncated protein which could explain the unexpected clinical status.\nThis variant is not reported in any SNV database. The gene constraint (gnomAD) indicates a strong probability of being LoF intolerant (oe-score: 0.06); therefore, it was considered pathogenic. In addition, we did not identify any exonic/splicing variants in the other coding regions.\nWe also evaluated CNVs/LOH through SNP-CGH arrays, which allowed for the exclusion of any possible genomic rearrangements and also reinforced data from the literature reporting that haploinsufficiency and partial deregulation of  PHD2  is sufficient to cause polycythemia [ 49 ].\nComputational analysis indicated two possible effects of the truncated peptide. Firstly, an interaction between the truncated peptide and wild-type PHD2 protein was hypothesized. The truncated protein reduces the propensity to generate PHD2 dimerization-blocking establishment of the disulfide bond among DSBH domains and subsequently hindering HIF-1\u03b1 activation by increasing glucose flux and lactate production (the Warburg effect) under oxidative stress. This interference could have a protective effect, decreasing tumor growth, as seen in our patient. Secondly, the interaction and inhibition of the transcriptional regulation of NCoR2 were considered, which would lead to the activation of HDAC3 and repression of nuclear receptors such as the thyroid hormone receptor and the retinoic acid receptor. HDAC3 is recruited by enhancers to modulate both the epigenome and nearby gene expression and is the only endogenous histone deacetylase that has a unique role in modulating the transcriptional activities of nuclear receptors.\nMoreover, the heterozygous nonsense variant in the  PHD2  gene, as well as the residual mRNA produced by the wild-type allele, may act in a dominant-negative fashion to lower protein activity, possibly leading to a non-canonical-associated phenotype with metastatic Pheo, but with no clinical signs of polycythemia.\nAt genetic analysis, the patient's father was positive for the known  PHD2  variant. CT scan and metanephrine assays proved negative. To date, considering the rarity of  PHD2  variants, the penetrance of this variant is unknown. An incomplete penetrance could be assumed, such as that of  SDHB  germline variants (9-75%) [ 50 ]. Indeed, in the previously reported cases, it was not possible to study the transmission of the disease [ 34 , 35 , 45 ].\nOn the other hand, autosomal dominant inheritance has been reported in patients affected by  PHD2  variants and polycythemia [ 51 ].\nIn summary, the role of  PHD2  heterozygous state as the driver gene associated with an unusual phenotype could depend on its relative abundance in a specific tissue, its interplaying among the three isoforms, as well as other genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.\nWe can neither exclude the presence of other variants in the non-coding or regulatory regions nor epigenetic alteration that, in association with the nonsense variant in the  PHD2  gene, may contribute to the development of the patient's phenotype.\nIn agreement with the literature [ 52 ], we demonstrated that the  PHD2  variant led to HIF stabilization and its consequent activation through a significant increase in HIF2\u03b1 expression in the mutated tumor. Focusing on HIF activation, we suggest a possible correlation between HIF upregulation and response to CML therapy. Considering the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, we have not assumed a possible relationship between PPRT therapy and CML. In the literature, there are no data on this correlation.\nIn CML cell populations, HIF-responsive genes are upregulated by BCR/Abl [ 53 ]. Under low oxygen conditions, HIF supports the maintenance of stem cell potential, promoting the expansion of the mutated progenitor and an increased production of BCR/Abl protein [ 54 ]. This mechanism could be maintained in pseudohypoxia conditions. In CML murine models, HIF-1\u03b1 genetic knockout prevents CML development by impairing cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) [ 55 ]. Therefore, HIF-1\u03b1 is a critical factor in CML. LSCs, selected under low oxygen tension, are tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-insensitive [ 56 ] and HIF-1\u03b1-dependent signaling is relevant to LSC maintenance in CML [ 57 ]. This establishes HIF targeting as a possible strategy for CML treatment in patients who are insensitive to Imatinib and other TKI inhibitors [ 58 ]. Our patient was given Imatinib only recently. Future studies are necessary in order to verify the response to TKI inhibitors in  PHD2 -mutated patients. The description of an unusual clinical feature through NGS DNA analysis can significantly increase the diagnostic rate and improve patient management regardless of specific clinical signs.\n"], "ner": [[[37, 41, "GENE"], [43, 59, "RELATION"], [96, 100, "DISEASE"], [105, 108, "DISEASE"], [129, 141, "DISEASE"], [164, 168, "GENE"], [170, 186, "RELATION"], [226, 238, "DISEASE"], [253, 256, "DISEASE"], [304, 308, "GENE"], [310, 335, "RELATION"], [374, 378, "DISEASE"], [411, 415, "GENE"], [417, 442, "RELATION"], [480, 492, "DISEASE"], [567, 584, "RELATION"], [593, 597, "GENE"], [679, 691, "DISEASE"], [783, 795, "DISEASE"], [855, 859, "GENE"], [890, 901, "RELATION"], [907, 919, "DISEASE"], [[967, 988], [982, 1020], "RELATION"], [983, 987, "GENE"], [1021, 1033, "DISEASE"], [1063, 1067, "GENE"], [1148, 1152, "DISEASE"], [1257, 1261, "GENE"], [1276, 1322, "GENE"], [1324, 1328, "GENE"], [1817, 1820, "GENE"], [2118, 2122, "GENE"], [2171, 2175, "GENE"], [2399, 2403, "GENE"], [2425, 2430, "GENE"], [2488, 2492, "GENE"], [2520, 2525, "GENE"], [2613, 2617, "GENE"], [3223, 3241, "RELATION"], [3246, 3266, "RELATION"], [3271, 3275, "GENE"], [3300, 3312, "DISEASE"], [3469, 3473, "GENE"], [3557, 3561, "GENE"], [3666, 3672, "GENE"], [3956, 3961, "GENE"]], [[4017, 4022, "GENE"], [4128, 4133, "GENE"], [4407, 4411, "GENE"], [4621, 4625, "DISEASE"], [4657, 4669, "DISEASE"], [4741, 4745, "GENE"], [4841, 4845, "GENE"], [5214, 5218, "GENE"], [5279, 5283, "GENE"], [5691, 5695, "GENE"], [5832, 5836, "GENE"], [5935, 5940, "GENE"], [6077, 6080, "DISEASE"], [6216, 6219, "DISEASE"], [6282, 6285, "DISEASE"], [6614, 6617, "DISEASE"], [6666, 6669, "DISEASE"], [6790, 6796, "GENE"], [6802, 6817, "RELATION"], [6821, 6824, "DISEASE"], [6926, 6932, "GENE"], [6987, 6990, "DISEASE"], [7057, 7060, "DISEASE"], [7277, 7281, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[37, 41, 96, 100, "associated mutation"], [37, 41, 105, 108, "associated mutation"], [164, 168, 226, 238, "associated mutation"], [164, 168, 253, 256, "associated mutation"], [304, 308, 374, 378, "associated mutation"], [593, 597, 679, 691, "associated mutation"], [855, 859, 907, 919, "relation undefined"], [983, 987, 1021, 1033, "causative inhibition"], [3271, 3275, 3300, 3312, "associated mutation"], [3271, 3275, 3300, 3312, "dysregulation"]], [[6790, 6796, 6821, 6824, "relation undefined"]]], "triplets": [[[37, 41, 96, 100, 43, 59], [37, 41, 105, 108, 43, 59], [164, 168, 226, 238, 170, 186], [164, 168, 253, 256, 170, 186], [304, 308, 374, 378, 310, 335], [593, 597, 679, 691, 567, 584], [855, 859, 907, 919, 890, 901], [983, 987, 1021, 1033, [967, 988], [982, 1020]], [3271, 3275, 3300, 3312, 3223, 3241], [3271, 3275, 3300, 3312, 3246, 3266]], [[6790, 6796, 6821, 6824, 6802, 6817]]], "triplets_text": [[["PHD2", "Pheo", "germline variant"], ["PHD2", "CML", "germline variant"], ["PHD2", "polycythemia", "missense variant"], ["PHD2", "PGL", "missense variant"], ["PHD2", "Pheo", "germline missense variant"], ["PHD2", "polycythemia", "nonsense variants"], ["PHD2", "polycythemia", "association"], ["PHD2", "polycythemia", "partial loss of activity is sufficient to induce"], ["PHD2", "polycythemia", "haploinsufficiency"], ["PHD2", "polycythemia", "partial deregulation"]], [["HIF - 1\u03b1", "CML", "critical factor"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nHere, we describe a novel nonsense  PHD2  germline variant in a patient affected by metastatic Pheo and CML with no evidence of polycythemia.\nThe first case of a  PHD2  missense variant observed in a 30-year-old patient with polycythemia and abdominal PGL was reported in 2008 [ 34 ].

Germline variants account for approximately 40%, while the remaining 30% is attributable to somatic variants. Objective: This study aimed to describe a new  PHD2  ( EGLN1 ) variant in a patient affected by metastatic Pheo and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) without polycythemia and to emphasize the need to adopt a comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Methods: Genetic analysis was carried out by NGS. This analysis was initially performed using a panel of genes known for tumor predisposition ( EGLN1 ,  EPAS1 ,  FH ,  KIF1B beta,  MAX ,  NF1 ,  RET ,  SDHA ,  SDHAF2 ,  SDHB ,  SDHC ,  SDHD ,  TMEM127 , and  VHL ), followed initially by SNP-CGH array, to exclude the presence of the pathogenic Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and subsequently by whole exome sequencing (WES) comparative sequence analysis of the DNA extracted from tumor fragments and peripheral blood. Results: We found a novel germline  PHD2  ( EGLN1 ) gene variant, c.153G>A, p.W51*, in a patient affected by metastatic Pheo and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the absence of polycythemia.

Germline variants account for approximately 40%, while the remaining 30% is attributable to somatic variants. Objective: This study aimed to describe a new  PHD2  ( EGLN1 ) variant in a patient affected by metastatic Pheo and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) without polycythemia and to emphasize the need to adopt a comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Methods: Genetic analysis was carried out by NGS. This analysis was initially performed using a panel of genes known for tumor predisposition ( EGLN1 ,  EPAS1 ,  FH ,  KIF1B beta,  MAX ,  NF1 ,  RET ,  SDHA ,  SDHAF2 ,  SDHB ,  SDHC ,  SDHD ,  TMEM127 , and  VHL ), followed initially by SNP-CGH array, to exclude the presence of the pathogenic Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and subsequently by whole exome sequencing (WES) comparative sequence analysis of the DNA extracted from tumor fragments and peripheral blood. Results: We found a novel germline  PHD2  ( EGLN1 ) gene variant, c.153G>A, p.W51*, in a patient affected by metastatic Pheo and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the absence of polycythemia.

{"doc_key": "9416477_1. Introduction", "text": ["\nPheochromocytoma (Pheo) and paraganglioma (PGL) are rare tumors with an incidence of 2-5 patients per million per year and an uncertain malignant potential [ 1 ]. Pheos represent about 80-85% of cases and PGLs represent about 15-20% [ 2 ]. The recommended diagnostic workup for suspected Pheo/PGL (PPGL) includes plasma free metanephrines and fractionated urinary metanephrines. Subsequently, computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to locate the lesion [ 3 ]. Nuclear medicine exams such as  123 I-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy,  18 F-fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine ( 18 F-DOPA), and  68 Ga-DOTATATE PET are predominantly used in patients with metastatic disease [ 4 , 5 ].\nSurgery is the curative option in non-metastatic and metastatic PPGL, and in patients with metastatic disease, tumor resection has been reported to increase overall survival [ 6 ].\nMedical therapy with alpha-blockers is necessary before surgery [ 7 ]. In patients affected by metastatic disease, 'wait and see' is the first option given the generally slow evolution of the disease [ 8 ]. Radiometabolic therapies with  131 I-MIBG or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PPRT) have proved effective [ 9 , 10 ], while cyclophosphamide vincristine dacarbazine (CVD) is the chemotherapy most commonly administered [ 11 ]. Local therapy such as external radiation therapy, radiosurgery, radiofrequency, cryoablation, and ethanol injection should be considered for unresectable lesions [ 12 ]. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, e.g., Sunitinib [ 13 ], Temozolomide [ 14 ], as well as immunotherapy such as Pembrolizumab [ 15 ], are novel medical options for metastatic PPGLs.\nUp to 70% of PPGLs are caused by germline or somatic pathogenic variants in one of the known susceptibility genes [ 16 , 17 ]. Based on their transcriptional profile, PPGLs are classified into three clusters. Cluster 1 includes PPGLs with variants in genes encoding the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) 2\u03b1, the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor ( VHL ), the prolyl hydroxylase domain ( PHD ), fumarate hydratase ( FH ), and succinate dehydrogenase subunits ( SDHx ) [ 18 , 19 ]. These tumors are characterized by the activation of pseudohypoxic pathways and by an immature catecholamine-secreting phenotype [ 20 ]. Cluster 2 comprises PPGLs with pathogenic variants in the REarranged during Transfection ( RET ) proto-oncogene, the Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) tumor suppressor gene, the TransMEMbrane protein ( TMEM127 ) gene, the Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( HRAS ) and the MYC Associated Factor X ( MAX ) gene. Cluster 2 PPGLs show activated MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways and are mostly benign exhibiting a mature catecholamine phenotype with a strong expression of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. Cluster 3 is the Wnt signaling cluster. These tumors are due to somatic mutations of the  CSDE1  gene or somatic gene fusions of the  MAML3  gene [ 2 ], but also patients with sporadic forms fall into this cluster. Cluster 3 tumors have a more aggressive behavior [ 19 ].\nDue to the large number of known susceptibility genes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is ideally suited for carrying out PPGL genetic screening.\nThe genetic screening proposed by Toledo et al. [ 25 ] includes the  PHD2  (also called  EGLN1)  gene (Egl-9 Family Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1). The encoded protein catalyzes the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins. HIF is a transcriptional complex, playing a central role in mammalian oxygen homeostasis, controlling energy, iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, development under hypoxic or pseudohypoxic conditions and mediating adaptive cell responses to these states. Under normoxic conditions, HIF is controlled by several enzymatic reactions, including prolyl hydroxylation by PHDs, leading to proteasome degradation. However, pseudohypoxia conditions can lead to HIF stabilization and transactivation of target genes [ 26 , 27 ].\nDysregulation of HIF contributes to tumorigenesis and cancer progression [ 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 ]. HIF also has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neuroendocrine tumors, especially PPGLs, regulating the cluster 1 pathway. Furthermore,  PHD2  heterozygous variants cause polycythemia, supporting the importance of PHD2 in the control of red cell mass in humans [ 32 , 33 ] that may be associated with PPGL [ 34 , 35 ].\nHere, we report a novel germline  PHD2  variant in a patient affected by metastatic Pheo and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the absence of polycythemia.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 17, "DISEASE"], [19, 23, "DISEASE"], [29, 42, "DISEASE"], [44, 47, "DISEASE"], [164, 168, "DISEASE"], [206, 209, "DISEASE"], [289, 293, "DISEASE"], [294, 297, "DISEASE"], [2006, 2040, "GENE"], [2043, 2046, "GENE"], [2089, 2107, "GENE"], [2110, 2112, "GENE"], [2369, 2399, "GENE"], [2402, 2405, "GENE"], [2428, 2452, "GENE"], [2455, 2458, "GENE"], [2512, 2519, "GENE"], [2532, 2573, "GENE"], [2576, 2580, "GENE"], [2591, 2614, "GENE"], [2617, 2620, "GENE"], [2946, 2951, "GENE"], [2990, 2995, "GENE"], [3355, 3359, "GENE"], [3375, 3380, "GENE"], [3389, 3428, "GENE"]], [[4135, 4141, "DISEASE"], [4317, 4321, "GENE"], [4323, 4350, "RELATION"], [4351, 4363, "DISEASE"], [4394, 4398, "GENE"], [[4523, 4539], [4531, 4546], "RELATION"], [4533, 4537, "GENE"], [4583, 4587, "DISEASE"], [4592, 4616, "DISEASE"], [4618, 4621, "DISEASE"], [4641, 4653, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], [[4317, 4321, 4351, 4363, "causative mutation"], [4533, 4537, 4583, 4587, "associated mutation"], [4533, 4537, 4592, 4616, "associated mutation"], [4533, 4537, 4618, 4621, "associated mutation"]]], "triplets": [[], [[4317, 4321, 4351, 4363, 4323, 4350], [4533, 4537, 4583, 4587, [4523, 4539], [4531, 4546]], [4533, 4537, 4592, 4616, [4523, 4539], [4531, 4546]], [4533, 4537, 4618, 4621, [4523, 4539], [4531, 4546]]]], "triplets_text": [[], [["PHD2", "polycythemia", "heterozygous variants cause"], ["PHD2", "Pheo", "germline variant"], ["PHD2", "chronic myeloid leukemia", "germline variant"], ["PHD2", "CML", "germline variant"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nPheochromocytoma (Pheo) and paraganglioma (PGL) are rare tumors with an incidence of 2-5 patients per million per year and an uncertain malignant potential [ 1 ].

{"doc_key": "9288359_Introduction", "text": ["\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and second most common in Taiwan [ 1 ,  2 ]. For patients with advanced HCC, the prognosis is poor. Sorafenib, a multiple kinase inhibitor, has been the only approved drug for a decade, but the efficacy is limited [ 3 ]. Recently, several drugs including lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab have been approved for the treatment of advanced HCC [ 4 - 7 ].Particularly, the combination of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody)provided longer survival benefit than sorafenib and has become a new standard therapy in first-line treatment for advanced HCC [ 8 ]. However, little is known for the combination of multi-kinase inhibitor and anti-PD-1.\nLenvatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that affects `1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRa), RET, and KIT [ 9 ]. By blocking these pathways, it reduces angiogenesis and suppresses tumor growth. Its potent inhibition of FGFR pathway is considered the primary mechanism for controlling liver cancer. In REFLECT study, lenvatinib demonstrated better response and longer PFS, and non-inferiority of survival than that of sorafenib [ 4 ].\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors have been widely studied in various cancers. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, two anti-PD-1 agents, become breakthrough therapies in the second-line treatment of advanced HCC [ 10 ,  11 ]. However, in a phase 3 clinical trial (CheckMate-459), nivolumab failed to prove its superiority to sorafenib in the first-line treatment [ 12 ]. Therefore, to explore a potential drug for combination becomes the future development for nivolumab.\nAt present, more and more evidence has shown that VEGF pathway inhibitors have immunomodulatory effects [ 13 ]. The combination of VEGF pathway inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 improves treatment efficacy and becomes standard treatment in HCC [ 8 ]. Many multi-kinase inhibitors that block VEGF pathway have been proved to have immunomodulatory effects, including lenvatinib [ 14 ]. Lenvatinib, a potent FGFR inhibitor, not only suppressed the progression of HCC, but also activated the immune response in tumor microenvironment [ 15 ]. Therefore, lenvatinib is potential for the combination of anti-PD-1. However, only a Phase 1 clinical trial showed the efficacy of lenvatinib combined with nivolumab, and no real-world data is reported to respond to the clinical trial [ 16 ].

Recently, several drugs including lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab have been approved for the treatment of advanced HCC [ 4 - 7 ].Particularly, the combination of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody)provided longer survival benefit than sorafenib and has become a new standard therapy in first-line treatment for advanced HCC [ 8 ]. However, little is known for the combination of multi-kinase inhibitor and anti-PD-1.\nLenvatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that affects `1-4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRa), RET, and KIT [ 9 ]. By blocking these pathways, it reduces angiogenesis and suppresses tumor growth. Its potent inhibition of FGFR pathway is considered the primary mechanism for controlling liver cancer. In REFLECT study, lenvatinib demonstrated better response and longer PFS, and non-inferiority of survival than that of sorafenib [ 4 ].\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors have been widely studied in various cancers. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, two anti-PD-1 agents, become breakthrough therapies in the second-line treatment of advanced HCC [ 10 ,  11 ]. However, in a phase 3 clinical trial (CheckMate-459), nivolumab failed to prove its superiority to sorafenib in the first-line treatment [ 12 ]. Therefore, to explore a potential drug for combination becomes the future development for nivolumab.\nAt present, more and more evidence has shown that VEGF pathway inhibitors have immunomodulatory effects [ 13 ]. The combination of VEGF pathway inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 improves treatment efficacy and becomes standard treatment in HCC [ 8 ]. Many multi-kinase inhibitors that block VEGF pathway have been proved to have immunomodulatory effects, including lenvatinib [ 14 ]. Lenvatinib, a potent FGFR inhibitor, not only suppressed the progression of HCC, but also activated the immune response in tumor microenvironment [ 15 ]. Therefore, lenvatinib is potential for the combination of anti-PD-1. However, only a Phase 1 clinical trial showed the efficacy of lenvatinib combined with nivolumab, and no real-world data is reported to respond to the clinical trial [ 16 ]. Hence, the purpose of this study is to explore the clinical efficacy and side effects of lenvatinib combined with nivolumab in the real-world settings.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "9288359_Discussion", "text": ["\nTo our knowledge, this is the first real-world report regarding the combination use of lenvatinib and nivolumab in advanced HCC which showed promising results with an ORR of 45.0% by mRECIST, PFS of 7.5 months, and OS of 14.6 months. These data suggested that lenvatinib plus nivolumab a potential combination in advanced HCC.\nCumulative evidence disclosed that the activation of FGF pathway signaling had an essential role in developing and worsening HCC [ 18 ]. Matsuki et al. performed in vitro studies in human HCC cell lines and in vivo studies in mice xenograft models showing that FGF19 -FGFR4 axis enhanced HCC proliferation and growth [ 19 ]. These findings may explain the high response rate of lenvatinib, a FGFR 1-4 inhibitor, in advanced HCC [ 4 ].\nLenvatinib, like other multiple kinase inhibitors, has been found to have immunomodulatory effects [ 14 ]. VEGFA and bFGF significantly upregulated the expression of immune-checkpoint markers and inhibited secretion of IFN-gamma and granzyme B, which suppressed T cell cytotoxicity. This immunosuppressive effect was reverted by lenvatinib [ 20 ]. Another study showed the activation of FGFR signaling downregulated JAK/STAT pathway leading to the decrease of IFN-gamma secretion. With the use of lenvatinib inhibited FGFR signaling restoring the IFN-gamma stimulation [ 21 ]. In addition, several studies demonstrated that lenvatinib increased the percentage of activated CD8 + T cells that secreting IFN-gamma and granzyme B [ 15 ,  21 ,  22 ]. However, the antitumor activity of lenvatinib was attenuated in immunodeficient mice by CD8 + T cell depletion [ 15 ]. On the other hand, lenvatinib decreased the proportion of monocytes and macrophages population, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [ 15 ,  21 ,  22 ]. Taking together, lenvatinib promoted anti-tumor immunity by increased IFN-gamma-producing CD8 T-cell and decreased TAMs, which makes lenvatinib potential to combine with immunotherapy.\nLenvatinib combined with anti-PD-1 induced greater antitumor activity and had longer survival in animal model of renal cell carcinoma [ 21 ]. Two HCC syngeneic mouse model showed that the combination therapy increased more percentage of IFN-gamma + and granzyme B + CD8 + T cells and decreased the macrophages population [ 15 ,  22 ]. Combined therapy also reducedPD-1 + T cells and modulated inflammatory factors which had an extensive immunomodulatory effect in the tumor microenvironment in HCC mouse model. Additionally, the immunomodulatory effect was more potent when combined with lenvatinib than sorafenib [ 20 ].Therefore, the combination of lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 synergistically modulated the TME and enhanced antitumor immunity.\nLenvatinib combined anti-PD-1 has been approved in endometrial carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. In KEYNOTE-775/Study 309, lenvatinib and pembrolizumab demonstrated an ORR of 30%, PFS 6.6 months (HR 0.60) and OS 17.4 months (HR 0.68), which was superior to doxorubicin or paclitaxel in platinum-experienced endometrial carcinoma [ 23 ]. In renal cell carcinoma, the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab was highly effective with an ORR of 38% in the phase Ib/II trial KEYNOTE-146 [ 24 ]. In the phase III CLEAR trial, lenvatinib combined with pembrolizumab showed a longer PFS (23.9 vs. 9.2 months; HR 0.39) and OS (HR 0.66) than sunitinib [ 25 ]. In HCC, a phase Ib study of lenvatinib plus nivolumab showed the ORR of 54% and PFS of 7.4 months [ 16 ]. Another phase I-II study of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab had the ORR of 36% and PFS of 8.6 months [ 26 ]. These clinical trials revealed promising results that is comparable with the synergistic effect in animal model.\nFor the treatment outcomes of other combined regimens in advanced HCC, a global open-labeled phase III trial (IMbrave150) revealed atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had a higher ORR (27.3% vs. 11.9%), longer PFS (6.8 vs. 4.3 months) and OS (non-reached vs. 13.2 months) then sorafenib [ 8 ]. In the phase II study of CheckMate-040, the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab yielded an ORR of 27-32% andOS (12.5-22.8 months) among different dose of combination in HCC patients who progressed from sorafenib [ 27 ]. In our study, lenvatinib combined nivolumab showed an objective response rate of 45% and a median PFS of 7.3 months. Therefore, our study demonstrated comparable efficacy to the treatments mentioned above.\nThe most adverse effects were graded 1-2 in this study. Skin reactions such as dermatitis and pruritis, and hypothyroidism were most common and could be caused by lenvatinib or nivolumab. Severe AEs including two gastric intestinal bleeding and one duodenal perforation were more likely related to lenvatinib; one patient suffered grade 5 pneumonitis was likely related to nivolumab. Overall, the toxicity profile was comparable to those reported in the phase Ib study of lenvatinib combined nivolumab and phase I-II study of lenvatinib combined pembrolizumab [ 16 ,  28 ].\nThere were several limitations in our study. First, this is a retrospective study, the information bias and selection bias may exist. However, imbalanced factors of age and HBV infection were not independent risk factors. Therefore, this study still provided a proof of concept. Second, whether the results apply to non-Asian populations is unclear because of the different etiologies between Asian and Western countries. Nevertheless, the response and prognosis were not significantly different regardless of virus infection.\n"], "ner": [[[125, 128, "DISEASE"], [323, 326, "DISEASE"], [453, 456, "DISEASE"], [516, 519, "DISEASE"], [589, 594, "GENE"], [596, 601, "GENE"], [616, 619, "DISEASE"], [720, 726, "GENE"], [752, 755, "DISEASE"], [870, 875, "GENE"], [880, 884, "GENE"], [982, 991, "GENE"], [996, 1006, "GENE"], [1223, 1232, "GENE"], [1310, 1319, "GENE"], [2083, 2103, "DISEASE"], [2116, 2119, "DISEASE"], [2464, 2467, "DISEASE"], [2764, 2785, "DISEASE"], [2790, 2810, "DISEASE"], [3022, 3043, "DISEASE"], [3055, 3075, "DISEASE"], [3373, 3376, "DISEASE"], [3762, 3765, "DISEASE"]], [[4154, 4157, "DISEASE"], [4490, 4500, "DISEASE"], [4519, 4533, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], []], "triplets": [[], []], "triplets_text": [[], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nTo our knowledge, this is the first real-world report regarding the combination use of lenvatinib and nivolumab in advanced HCC which showed promising results with an ORR of 45.0% by mRECIST, PFS of 7.5 months, and OS of 14.6 months.

Spontaneous Cell Fusion\nTo generate cell fusion hybrids, either iMSC#3 (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) and HS578T Hyg (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) or iMSC#3 (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) and MDA-MB-231 Hyg (1 \u00d7 10 6 ) cells were co-cultivated in media specific for the appropriate breast cancer cell line at 5% CO 2  and 37 \u00b0C. After 24 h, media were replaced by media containing antibiotics (100 \u00b5g/mL hygromycin B (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany); 1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France)). Hybrid cells exhibiting double resistance were isolated and individually cultivated. Overall, 11 iMSC#3 \u00d7 HS578T Hyg hybrids, named MH#X, and 2 iMSC#3 \u00d7 MDA-MB-231 Hyg hybrids, namely, MM#X, were isolated (X = clone number).\n4.3. STR-Analysis\nShort tandem repeat analysis was performed by the working group of W. Gerding (Ruhr-University Bochum, Department of Human Genetics) using the Powerplex \u00ae  16HS System DC2101 (Promega). Therefore, 100 ng genomic DNA was prepared using the NucleoSpin \u00ae  tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH and Co. KG, D\u00fcren, Germany) per the manufacturer's instructions (concentration was photometrically determined) and sent to their laboratory. Examination of the degree of the relationship was performed using Excel.\n4.4. Osteogenic Differentiation\nFor osteogenic differentiation, 1 \u00d7 10 5  cells/well were seeded into a 6-well plate and incubated at 5% CO 2  and 37 \u00b0C for 1 day. On the next day, media were exchanged. Control cells received the cell-line-specific medium, while the tested cells got osteogenic differentiation medium consisting of DMEM (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS (FCS; Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany), 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), 100 nM dexamethasone 21-phosphate disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), 10 mM beta-glycerol phosphate (Merck, Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and 50 \u00b5M L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). The medium was replaced two times per week, and cells were cultured for 21 days at 5% CO 2  and 37 \u00b0C. Afterward, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stained with Alizarin Red S (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 30 min at RT and washed 3 times with aqua destillata (A. dest.).\n4.5. XTT Proliferation and Cytostatic Assay\nOn the first day, 2500 cells/well were seeded on a 96-well plate and cultured in a cell-type-specific medium. For proliferation studies, the medium was removed after 24 h and replaced by RPMI 1640 without phenol red (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). Then, 50 \u00b5g/well XTT and 0.25 \u00b5g/well PMS (AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) were added, and plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. After 3 h, the reaction was measured with an ELISA reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). This procedure was repeated after 48 h, 72 h and 96 h. For cytostatic studies, the medium was also removed after 24 h, and it was replaced by a medium containing either 0.1 \u00b5mol, 1 \u00b5mol or 10 \u00b5mol doxorubicin or paclitaxel (both: Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Afterward, cells were again incubated for 24 h before media were exchanged by RPMI 1640 without phenol red (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). Then, 50 \u00b5g/well XTT and 0.25 \u00b5g/well PMS were added, and plates were incubated 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. After 3 h, the reaction was measured with an ELISA (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) reader. This procedure was repeated after 48 h and 72 h.\nColony formation assay:\nIn a 6-well plate, 200 cells/well were seeded and cultured for 10 days, changing the cell-line-specific media after 2-3 days. After 10 days, the media were removed, and the cells were washed with PBS (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany). For fixation, 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used; for coloring of the cells, 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) was used. Crystal violet was incubated for 30 min at RT and afterward washed away with H 2 O. The plate was air-dried at RT. Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ (imagej.-nih.gov/ij/).\n4.6. Mammosphere Assay\nFor mammosphere assays, 96-well plates were coated with 1.2% poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) in ethanol and dried for 10 days at 37 \u00b0C. Five hundred cells/well were seeded and cultured in mammosphere formation medium at 37 \u00b0C for 7 days. Mammosphere formation medium consisted of two different media (medium I and II) in a ratio of 1:4. Medium I was composed of DMEM/F12 (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) + B27 supplement (Gibco, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) + 20 ng/mL FGF (human recombinant; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) + 20 ng/mL EGF (human recombinant; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) + 0.39 \u00b5g/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). Medium II is composed of Methocult H4100 (Stem Cells Technologies, K\u00f6ln, Germany) + DMEM (Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) (ratio 2:3). After 7 days, images were generated with a microscope and analyzed using ImageJ 1.8.0 ( https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html ).\n4.7. AldeRed Assay\nThe expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) was examined by using the AldeRed ALDH detection assay (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's manual. First, 2 \u00d7 10 5  cells were harvested and resuspended in AldeRed assay buffer containing the efflux inhibitor Verapamil and AldeRed 588A substrate. One half of the cell suspension was transferred to a new reaction tube and provided with diethylamino-benzaldehyde (DEAB), which is a specific ALDH1 inhibitor; this sample served as a control. Afterward, cells were incubated for 45 min at 37 \u00b0C in the dark and centrifuged (300\u00d7  g , 5 min). The cell pellet was washed in 500 \u00b5L of AldeRed assay buffer. Samples were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickenson, Heidelberg, Germany), and FACS data were evaluated using WinMDI 2.9.\n4.8. Flow Cytometry\nFlow cytometry was used to analyze CSC and EMT markers in hybrid and parental cells. In this experiment, 1.5 \u00d7 10 5  cells were stained with different antibodies in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and measured with a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, Heidelberg, Germany). Isotype-matched antibodies served as controls. All antibodies are listed in  Table 1 .\n4.9. Western Blot\nFor the generation of Western blot samples, 2 \u00d7 10 5  cells were treated with 3\u00d7 Lemmli sample buffer (ratio 1:2) and lysed for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C. EGF-stimulated samples were treated with 100 ng/mL EGF (human recombinant; Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) for 1, 2 or 5 min before 3\u00d7 Lemmli sample buffer was added and cells were lysed for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C. For 8%, 10% or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the samples were separated and afterward transferred to an Immobilon polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) nitrocellulose membrane (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) under semidry conditions. The membranes were then blocked with 5% ( w / v ) nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for at least 1 h. All antibodies were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Visualization of protein bands was executed by using the Pierce ECL Western blot substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bonn, Germany) and the Aequoria macroscopic imaging system (Hamamatsu Photonics Germany, Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany). All images were evaluated using ImageJ (imagej.-nih.gov/ij/).\n4.10. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.

{"doc_key": "7765946_3. Discussion", "text": ["\nIn the present study, we characterized hybrid cells obtained by the fusion of human BC cells and human MSCs. We wanted to examine whether CSC-like cells can be formed by cell fusion and if CSCs might develop certain properties during this process. We used MSCs because these cells are located in the tumor microenvironment where they are in direct contact with cancer cells and might contribute stem-like properties, i.e., inducing EMT. The tumor microenvironment affects tumor progression and cell fusion in a crucial way, enabling different cell types to come in contact and containing molecules such as cytokines, which might function as inducers for different processes such as cell fusion [ 28 ]. Even if the cancer stem cell theory and the role of cell fusion in this context had been doubted, many previous studies have demonstrated that cancer cells are able to fuse to other cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as fibroblasts [ 29 ] or macrophages [ 15 , 16 , 19 , 30 ]. In 1998, Rachkovsky et al. described the formation of macrophage x melanoma cell hybrids with an enhanced migration capacity [ 30 ]. In 2017, Linstr\u00f6m et al. demonstrated that macrophage:MCF7-hybrids have a higher radioresistant capacity [ 19 ], and Clawson et al. found macrophage hybrids in the blood of melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients [ 15 , 16 ]. Additionally, fibroblast \u00d7 melanoma hybrids had been described as exhibiting a fibroblast-like phenotype [ 29 ]. These studies demonstrate that cancer cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment are able to fuse in vivo and in vitro and give rise to hybrid cells expressing stem cell properties.\nWe also wanted to look for CSC properties in our hybrid cells. Therefore, we used different markers that had been described before. Dontu et al. were the first to describe the formation of mammospheres by human mammary stem/progenitor cells [ 31 ]. They elucidated the formation of nonadherent 3D structures as a characteristic of stem cells. Yousefnia et al. used three different BC cell lines to generate mammospheres and described the stemness phenotype with the use of an in vivo chick embryo model. All mammospheres showed increased proliferation, migration and drug resistance potential and higher tumorigenicity compared to the corresponding cell lines [ 32 ]. In this study, mammospheres were formed by all four hybrid clones, HS578T Hyg and iMSC#3 cells, but not by MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells ( Figure 3 ). MDA-MB-231 and other common breast cancer cell lines, which do not express E-cadherin, form cell clumps in sphere-forming assays [ 33 ]. If the mammospheres also show different tumorigenic potential, this finding must be evaluated in further studies. Additionally, it must be clarified why MSCs formed fewer and smaller mammospheres, as HS578T Hyg cells did. This finding likely indicates that putative cancer stem-like cells proliferate faster than MSCs.\nIn addition to the formation of mammospheres, ALDH1-positive cells, and a CD44 + /CD24 -/low  phenotype are distinctive for stem-like cell lines [ 25 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ]. In our study, we were able to demonstrate that approximately 90% of the cells per cell line expressed a CD44 + /CD24 -/low  phenotype ( Figure 4 ). Differences were found in the expression of ALDH1. The hybrids MM#2, MM#3 and MH#9 showed an increased number of these cells compared to the BC parental cells ( Figure 4 ). However, a relationship between the number of ALDH1-positive cells, CD44 + /CD24 -/low  cells and the formation of mammospheres was not detectable for the tested cell lines. Each hybrid cell line possessed individual capabilities, which seem to not have any correlation. This result confirms what was shown in our previous study, which also found no correlation between the number of ALDH1-positive cells and the formation of mammospheres using M13SV1-EGFP-Neo and different BC cell line hybrids [ 22 ]. It also must be discussed whether stem cells truly exhibit a stable phenotype or if they rather are in a state of the permanent shift [ 38 ]. This would make it more difficult to identify them, and standard methods may be revised [ 39 ].\nBesides these studies, others demonstrated that the fusion of cancer cells with other cells led to hybrid cells with an increased tumorigenic and metastatic potential and an altered drug-/radioresistance capacity [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 ]. To test whether similar propositions can be made for our hybrid cells, we analyzed their proliferation rate, their capacity to form colonies and their behavior under cytotoxic conditions. We demonstrated that MM#2 and MH#7 had an increased proliferation rate compared to both parental cell lines ( Figure 1 ). On the other hand, the colony-forming capacity was increased for all hybrid cells compared to iMSC#3 cells ( Figure 2 ). Under low cytotoxic conditions (0.1 \u00b5M), only MH#7 and MH#9 showed a slightly increased resistance against doxorubicin. For other concentrations and paclitaxel, no resistance potential was detectable ( Figure 7 ). Whether our tested hybrid cells truly are more tumorigenic than the BC cell lines must be tested with in vivo studies.\nFurthermore, it is unclear which impact epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and its reversal mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) might have on tumor progression. The transition of an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype is induced by different transcription factors such as SLUG, SNAIL, TWIST, ZEB1 and ZEB2 [ 44 , 45 , 46 ], leading to the loss of E-cadherin, which is necessary for cell-cell adhesion. Cells executing EMT are able to enter the bloodstream, where they might be able to exist as circulating tumor cells or undergo MET to enter into the tissue of a distant organ. Kr\u00f6ger et al. determined a so-called hybrid E/M state, which is characterized by the expression of CD44 hi /CD104 +  cells [ 27 ]. Cells in this state are highly tumorigenic. Our analyzed hybrid populations exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype in over 80% of the cells. For the MDA-MB-231 Hyg cell line, approximately 40% of the cells expressed a hybrid E/M state. More difficult is the analysis of our Western blot data. Transcription factors were expressed differently in all tested cell lines. SLUG, SNAIL, vimentin and ZEB2 are highly expressed in all cell lines, while the expression of SOX9, Twist and ZEB1 was observed to be less or only in distinct cell lines. E-cadherin was not expressed in any cell line, and N-cadherin-a mesenchymal marker-was only expressed in iMSC#3 and MM#2 cells, which is remarkable compared to the flow cytometry results ( Figure 5 ).\nIn summary, in this study, we tested the mesenchymal/cancer stem cell characteristics of four hybrid cell clones in various experiments. There were no obvious correlations between distinct properties; rather, all hybrid cells exhibited individual characteristics that were not predictable. Our results indicate that cell fusion leads to the formation of a heterogenic cell population with a variety of capabilities. These results confirm a plurality of studies describing the same results for cell fusion hybrid cells [ 7 , 14 , 22 , 47 , 48 ]. However, it is unclear whether the generated hybrid cells are more tumorigenic than parental cancer cells. In a recent study, Melzer et al. demonstrated that MDA-hyb3 cells generated by the fusion of MSC and MDA-MB-231 cells showed a reduced tumor formation rate compared to MDA-MB-231 cells when injected subcutaneously in both flanks of NOD/SCID mice [ 49 ]. The number of hybrid cells that is necessary in vivo to show an effect in tumor progression remains to be elucidated, which differs in comparison to tumors in which no cell fusion events took place. These effects may be a higher metastatic or proliferation rate. There are studies demonstrating that cell fusion events take place in vivo and play a role in tumor progression.\nIn the early 2000s, cell fusion hybrids were discovered in patients who had previously had a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) [ 50 , 51 ]. Gast et al. were able to detect fusion hybrid cells in biopsies of female pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients who previously received a sex-mismatched bone marrow transplant. They identified a Y-chromosome in epithelial cancer cells. Furthermore, they also identified fusion hybrids in the peripheral blood [ 14 ]. LaBerge et al. demonstrated that hybrid cells are also able to metastasize in vivo. Therefore, they analyzed primary melanoma cells and cells of the nodal metastasis of a patient who previously received a BMT and discovered alleles of both the patient and the BMT donor via STR-analysis [ 52 ].\nTumor heterogeneity remains one of the biggest problems cancer therapy must face.

We wanted to examine whether CSC-like cells can be formed by cell fusion and if CSCs might develop certain properties during this process. We used MSCs because these cells are located in the tumor microenvironment where they are in direct contact with cancer cells and might contribute stem-like properties, i.e., inducing EMT. The tumor microenvironment affects tumor progression and cell fusion in a crucial way, enabling different cell types to come in contact and containing molecules such as cytokines, which might function as inducers for different processes such as cell fusion [ 28 ]. Even if the cancer stem cell theory and the role of cell fusion in this context had been doubted, many previous studies have demonstrated that cancer cells are able to fuse to other cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as fibroblasts [ 29 ] or macrophages [ 15 , 16 , 19 , 30 ]. In 1998, Rachkovsky et al. described the formation of macrophage x melanoma cell hybrids with an enhanced migration capacity [ 30 ]. In 2017, Linstr\u00f6m et al. demonstrated that macrophage:MCF7-hybrids have a higher radioresistant capacity [ 19 ], and Clawson et al. found macrophage hybrids in the blood of melanoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients [ 15 , 16 ]. Additionally, fibroblast \u00d7 melanoma hybrids had been described as exhibiting a fibroblast-like phenotype [ 29 ]. These studies demonstrate that cancer cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment are able to fuse in vivo and in vitro and give rise to hybrid cells expressing stem cell properties.\nWe also wanted to look for CSC properties in our hybrid cells. Therefore, we used different markers that had been described before. Dontu et al. were the first to describe the formation of mammospheres by human mammary stem/progenitor cells [ 31 ]. They elucidated the formation of nonadherent 3D structures as a characteristic of stem cells. Yousefnia et al. used three different BC cell lines to generate mammospheres and described the stemness phenotype with the use of an in vivo chick embryo model. All mammospheres showed increased proliferation, migration and drug resistance potential and higher tumorigenicity compared to the corresponding cell lines [ 32 ]. In this study, mammospheres were formed by all four hybrid clones, HS578T Hyg and iMSC#3 cells, but not by MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells ( Figure 3 ). MDA-MB-231 and other common breast cancer cell lines, which do not express E-cadherin, form cell clumps in sphere-forming assays [ 33 ]. If the mammospheres also show different tumorigenic potential, this finding must be evaluated in further studies. Additionally, it must be clarified why MSCs formed fewer and smaller mammospheres, as HS578T Hyg cells did. This finding likely indicates that putative cancer stem-like cells proliferate faster than MSCs.\nIn addition to the formation of mammospheres, ALDH1-positive cells, and a CD44 + /CD24 -/low  phenotype are distinctive for stem-like cell lines [ 25 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ]. In our study, we were able to demonstrate that approximately 90% of the cells per cell line expressed a CD44 + /CD24 -/low  phenotype ( Figure 4 ). Differences were found in the expression of ALDH1. The hybrids MM#2, MM#3 and MH#9 showed an increased number of these cells compared to the BC parental cells ( Figure 4 ). However, a relationship between the number of ALDH1-positive cells, CD44 + /CD24 -/low  cells and the formation of mammospheres was not detectable for the tested cell lines. Each hybrid cell line possessed individual capabilities, which seem to not have any correlation. This result confirms what was shown in our previous study, which also found no correlation between the number of ALDH1-positive cells and the formation of mammospheres using M13SV1-EGFP-Neo and different BC cell line hybrids [ 22 ].", " It also must be discussed whether stem cells truly exhibit a stable phenotype or if they rather are in a state of the permanent shift [ 38 ]. This would make it more difficult to identify them, and standard methods may be revised [ 39 ].\nBesides these studies, others demonstrated that the fusion of cancer cells with other cells led to hybrid cells with an increased tumorigenic and metastatic potential and an altered drug-/radioresistance capacity [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 ]. To test whether similar propositions can be made for our hybrid cells, we analyzed their proliferation rate, their capacity to form colonies and their behavior under cytotoxic conditions. We demonstrated that MM#2 and MH#7 had an increased proliferation rate compared to both parental cell lines ( Figure 1 ). On the other hand, the colony-forming capacity was increased for all hybrid cells compared to iMSC#3 cells ( Figure 2 ). Under low cytotoxic conditions (0.1 \u00b5M), only MH#7 and MH#9 showed a slightly increased resistance against doxorubicin. For other concentrations and paclitaxel, no resistance potential was detectable ( Figure 7 ). Whether our tested hybrid cells truly are more tumorigenic than the BC cell lines must be tested with in vivo studies.\nFurthermore, it is unclear which impact epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and its reversal mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) might have on tumor progression. The transition of an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype is induced by different transcription factors such as SLUG, SNAIL, TWIST, ZEB1 and ZEB2 [ 44 , 45 , 46 ], leading to the loss of E-cadherin, which is necessary for cell-cell adhesion. Cells executing EMT are able to enter the bloodstream, where they might be able to exist as circulating tumor cells or undergo MET to enter into the tissue of a distant organ. Kr\u00f6ger et al. determined a so-called hybrid E/M state, which is characterized by the expression of CD44 hi /CD104 +  cells [ 27 ]. Cells in this state are highly tumorigenic. Our analyzed hybrid populations exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype in over 80% of the cells. For the MDA-MB-231 Hyg cell line, approximately 40% of the cells expressed a hybrid E/M state. More difficult is the analysis of our Western blot data. Transcription factors were expressed differently in all tested cell lines. SLUG, SNAIL, vimentin and ZEB2 are highly expressed in all cell lines, while the expression of SOX9, Twist and ZEB1 was observed to be less or only in distinct cell lines. E-cadherin was not expressed in any cell line, and N-cadherin-a mesenchymal marker-was only expressed in iMSC#3 and MM#2 cells, which is remarkable compared to the flow cytometry results ( Figure 5 ).\nIn summary, in this study, we tested the mesenchymal/cancer stem cell characteristics of four hybrid cell clones in various experiments. There were no obvious correlations between distinct properties; rather, all hybrid cells exhibited individual characteristics that were not predictable. Our results indicate that cell fusion leads to the formation of a heterogenic cell population with a variety of capabilities. These results confirm a plurality of studies describing the same results for cell fusion hybrid cells [ 7 , 14 , 22 , 47 , 48 ]. However, it is unclear whether the generated hybrid cells are more tumorigenic than parental cancer cells. In a recent study, Melzer et al. demonstrated that MDA-hyb3 cells generated by the fusion of MSC and MDA-MB-231 cells showed a reduced tumor formation rate compared to MDA-MB-231 cells when injected subcutaneously in both flanks of NOD/SCID mice [ 49 ]. The number of hybrid cells that is necessary in vivo to show an effect in tumor progression remains to be elucidated, which differs in comparison to tumors in which no cell fusion events took place. These effects may be a higher metastatic or proliferation rate. There are studies demonstrating that cell fusion events take place in vivo and play a role in tumor progression.", "\nIn the early 2000s, cell fusion hybrids were discovered in patients who had previously had a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) [ 50 , 51 ]. Gast et al. were able to detect fusion hybrid cells in biopsies of female pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients who previously received a sex-mismatched bone marrow transplant. They identified a Y-chromosome in epithelial cancer cells. Furthermore, they also identified fusion hybrids in the peripheral blood [ 14 ]. LaBerge et al. demonstrated that hybrid cells are also able to metastasize in vivo. Therefore, they analyzed primary melanoma cells and cells of the nodal metastasis of a patient who previously received a BMT and discovered alleles of both the patient and the BMT donor via STR-analysis [ 52 ].\nTumor heterogeneity remains one of the biggest problems cancer therapy must face. Many studies already demonstrated the diversity of fusion partners that cancer cells must create variegated tumor tissues, making it difficult to find the right treatment for all these cell subtypes.

{"doc_key": "7765946_2. Results", "text": ["\n2.1. Generation of Cell Fusion Hybrid Clones\nWithin tumor tissue, there are many different cell types, such as fibroblasts, immunocompetent cells and MSCs. To investigate if spontaneous cell fusion of MSCs and breast cancer cells could take place, in vitro studies were done. Therefore, two different human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 Hyg and HS578T Hyg) were separately cocultured with human immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC#3). Possible hybrid clones were identified by double antibiotic selection and verified by STR-analysis ( Figure S1 ). Four MDA-MB-231 Hyg \u00d7 iMSC#3 hybrid clones (named MM#X) were analyzed, but only two could be verified as proper hybrid clones. By the fusion of HS578T Hyg \u00d7 iMSC#3 cells, eleven hybrid clones were generated (named MH#X), but only 10 could be verified. For further studies, two hybrid clones from each fusion combination were selected, MM#2, MM#3, MH#7 and MH#9, because they showed the highest amount of overlapping parental alleles.\n2.2. General Characteristics of the Hybrid Clones\nInitially, general differences between the hybrid clones and their parental cell lines were examined. In an XTT-proliferation assay, the metabolic activity, which can be correlated to the proliferation of the cells, was tested. Hybrid clones MH#7 and MM#2 showed an increased proliferation rate in comparison to both parental cell lines, while MM#3 cells seemed to grow fast in the first 72 h, but then the proliferation rate decreased as fast as it first increased ( Figure 1 a). The large size of the cells may have had an impact on the proliferation rate; for example, the tight contact of the cells may have led to a growth arrest, or the cells had already reached the stationary phase within the growth curve. MH#9 cells proliferated faster than the iMSC#3, but slower than the HS578T Hyg cells.\nSkarn et al. showed that iMSC#3 cells were able to differentiate into osteoblasts [ 23 ]. Hence, the ability to differentiate was tested for MDA-MB-231 Hyg, HS578T Hyg and all four hybrid cells. As shown in  Figure 1 , in addition to iMSC#3 cells, all four hybrid cells were also able to differentiate. Notably, MM#2 seemed to undergo osteogenic differentiation to a greater extent than MH#7 and MH#9. MM, #3 formed some kind of 3D structure, detached from the plate surface, and formed knobs ( Figure 1 b, white arrow). From the parental BC cell lines, HS578T Hyg cells also showed an enhanced ability to differentiate in comparison to MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells. In summary, the results for MDA-MB-231 Hyg and MH#9 cells showed a lighter staining intensity, indicating that they did not express stem cell characteristics in a high manner, as, for instance, MM#2 cells did.\n2.3. Hybrid Clones Show Different and Distinct Expression Patterns of Stem Cell Characteristics\nTo test the clonogenic potential of the hybrid clones, a colony formation assay was performed. Hybrid clones MH#7 and MH#9 showed a significantly increased colony formation capacity in comparison to both parental cell lines. In addition, MM#2 and MM#3 cells were able to form more colonies than iMSC#3 cells ( Figure 2 a,b).\nNext, the ability to form mammospheres was tested. In comparison to iMSC#3 cells and HS578T-Hyg breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells formed loose cell aggregates rather than proper mammospheres ( Figure 3 a). The hybrids MM#2 and MM#3 were able to form proper mammospheres, which were larger than the iMSC#3 spheres, but did not form as many. The same applies to the hybrids MH#7 and MH#9. They showed slightly larger spheres than did iMSC#3 cells, but there were not as many. The BC cells HS578T Hyg exhibited the significantly largest and the highest amount of mammospheres of all tested cell lines ( Figure 3 b,c).\nIn summary, there seem to be correlations between the results of three in four experiments, but the constitutions differ between the single cell lines. For example, the XTT-assay, mammosphere diameter and osteogenic differentiation results demonstrate that MM#2 cells expressed these characteristics at a higher level, whereas MH#9 cells expressed them on a low level. In contrast, the CFA data show exactly the opposite result. These data indicate that hybrid cells express stem cell characteristics very individually.\nBy the use of the AldeRed Assay, the number of expressed ALDH1 positive cells was investigated. ALDH1 has been suggested to be a marker for adult stem cells, but also for cancer stem/initiating cells [ 25 ]. As expected, iMSC#3 cells produced the highest number of ALDH1-positive cells, approximately 6%. In contrast, virtually no ALDH1-positive MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells were detected, which is in agreement with other studies [ 22 , 26 ]. Interestingly, both MM#2 and MM#3 cells exhibited an increased number of ALDH1-positive cells in comparison to the MDA-MB-231 Hyg parental cell line. Analysis of MH#7 and MH#9 hybrid clones revealed that the number of ALDH1-positive cells, approximately 2%, was comparable to HS578T Hyg cells ( Figure 4 a).\nAn additional aid for identifying breast cancer stem cells is the expression of CD44 + /CD24 -/low  cells. The three parental cell lines and the four hybrid clones were analyzed using flow cytometry. In brief, all seven cell lines exhibited more than 90% of CD44 + /CD24 -/low  cells ( Figure 4 b).\n2.4. EMT-Marker\nEpithelial to mesenchymal transition markers include SLUG, SNAIL and SOX9, as well as CD44/CD104. The expression of CD44 + /CD104 +  is typical for cells undergoing EMT [ 27 ]. The presence of these markers was examined using FACS analysis. For all cell lines except MDA-MB-231 Hyg, over 80% of all cells exhibited a CD44 + /CD104 -  expression pattern, which is characteristic of mesenchymal cells ( Figure 5 a). Approximately 60% of MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells were CD44 + /CD104 -  and 40% were CD44 + /CD104 + . For hybrid clones MH#7 and MH#9, approximately 15-20% of all cells were CD44 + /CD104 + .\nIn addition to CD44/CD104, additional markers were examined in Western blot studies. The parental BC cell lines MDA-MB-231 Hyg and HS578T Hyg showed a similar expression profile. Both expressed SLUG, SNAIL, vimentin and ZEB2, but lacked E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1. While MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells lacked Twist, HS578T Hyg cells lacked SOX9 expression. iMSC#3 cells expressed all of the investigated markers except E-cadherin, but mostly in small amounts. The hybrid clone MM#2 showed a similar expression profile as iMSC#3 cells. MM#3 expressed a larger amount of SNAIL, SLUG, SOX9, vimentin and Twist in comparison to both parental cell lines. Therefore, no E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 were detectable. MH#7 and MH#9 also expressed more SNAIL, SOX9 and vimentin compared to both parental cell lines. Both MH-hybrid clones were negative for E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 ( Figure 5 b).\n2.5. Analysis of Signaling Kinetics\nLikewise, the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), HER3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also analyzed. While the expression of EGFR and HER2 was detectable for all cell lines, only MM#2 expressed HER3 ( Figure 6 a).\nTo analyze which signaling pathway may be active in the hybrid cells, cells were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 1, 2 or 5 min. Afterward, Western blot analysis was used to investigate if phosphorylated Akt and/or Erk1/2 is expressed ( Figure 6 b). Nonphosphorylated Akt was detectable in all cell lines except in iMSC#3 cells upon stimulation with EGF. Non-phosphorylated Erk1/2 was expressed by all cell lines, but in iMSC#3 and MH#9 cells, the amount seemed to be lower in stimulated cells compared to unstimulated cells. In iMSC#3, MDA-MB-231 Hyg, MM#2 and MM#3 cells, no phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) was detectable, while in HS578T Hyg, MH#7 and MH#9 cells, the amount of pAkt increased in accordance with EGF exposure time. Likewise, increasing amounts of phosphorylated Erk1/2 (pErk1/2) were seen in iMSC#3, HS578T Hyg and MH#7 cells, while the amount of pErk1/2 in the other cells was constant or even decreasing in accordance with the time of EGF treatment time. These results match the previous results regarding the mixed capacities hybrid cells gained from their parental cells.\n2.6. Cytotoxicity Tests\nTo test whether the hybrid clones react differently to cytostatic drugs, XTT analysis was performed using either paclitaxel or doxorubicin at concentrations of 0.1 \u00b5M/1 \u00b5M/10 \u00b5M. In brief, all cell lines died quickly after treatment with paclitaxel. Similar findings were observed after treatment with doxorubicin for iMSC#3, HS578T Hyg, and MM#2 cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 Hyg, MM#3, MH#7 and MH#9 cells exhibited resistance against doxorubicin at a concentration of 0.1 \u00b5M ( Figure 7 a,b).\n"], "ner": [[[211, 224, "DISEASE"], [308, 321, "DISEASE"], [2387, 2389, "DISEASE"], [3234, 3247, "DISEASE"], [3624, 3626, "DISEASE"]], [[4338, 4343, "GENE"], [4377, 4382, "GENE"], [4546, 4551, "GENE"], [4612, 4617, "GENE"], [4790, 4795, "GENE"], [4935, 4940, "GENE"], [5059, 5072, "DISEASE"], [5105, 5109, "GENE"], [5113, 5117, "GENE"], [5283, 5287, "GENE"], [5291, 5295, "GENE"], [5393, 5397, "GENE"], [5399, 5404, "GENE"], [5409, 5413, "GENE"], [5426, 5430, "GENE"], [5431, 5436, "GENE"], [5456, 5460, "GENE"], [5464, 5469, "GENE"], [5657, 5661, "GENE"], [5665, 5670, "GENE"], [5801, 5805, "GENE"], [5809, 5814, "GENE"], [5831, 5835, "GENE"], [5839, 5844, "GENE"], [5921, 5925, "GENE"], [5929, 5934, "GENE"], [5954, 5958, "GENE"], [5959, 5964, "GENE"], [6037, 6039, "DISEASE"], [6133, 6137, "GENE"], [6139, 6144, "GENE"], [6146, 6154, "GENE"], [6159, 6163, "GENE"], [6176, 6186, "GENE"], [6188, 6198, "GENE"], [6203, 6207, "GENE"], [6243, 6248, "GENE"], [6274, 6278, "GENE"], [6353, 6363, "GENE"], [6503, 6508, "GENE"], [6510, 6514, "GENE"], [6516, 6520, "GENE"], [6522, 6530, "GENE"], [6535, 6540, "GENE"], [6598, 6608, "GENE"], [6610, 6620, "GENE"], [6625, 6629, "GENE"], [6681, 6686, "GENE"], [6688, 6692, "GENE"], [6784, 6794, "GENE"], [6796, 6806, "GENE"], [6811, 6815, "GENE"], [6895, 6935, "GENE"], [6937, 6941, "GENE"], [6944, 6948, "GENE"], [6953, 6985, "GENE"], [6987, 6991, "GENE"], [7036, 7040, "GENE"], [7045, 7049, "GENE"], [7105, 7109, "GENE"], [7346, 7349, "GENE"], [7357, 7361, "GENE"], [7410, 7413, "GENE"], [7516, 7520, "GENE"], [7734, 7737, "GENE"], [7818, 7821, "GENE"]], [[7917, 7921, "GENE"], [7926, 7930, "GENE"], [8003, 8007, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2], "sentences": ["\n2.1.

Approximately 60% of MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells were CD44 + /CD104 -  and 40% were CD44 + /CD104 + . For hybrid clones MH#7 and MH#9, approximately 15-20% of all cells were CD44 + /CD104 + .\nIn addition to CD44/CD104, additional markers were examined in Western blot studies. The parental BC cell lines MDA-MB-231 Hyg and HS578T Hyg showed a similar expression profile. Both expressed SLUG, SNAIL, vimentin and ZEB2, but lacked E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1. While MDA-MB-231 Hyg cells lacked Twist, HS578T Hyg cells lacked SOX9 expression. iMSC#3 cells expressed all of the investigated markers except E-cadherin, but mostly in small amounts. The hybrid clone MM#2 showed a similar expression profile as iMSC#3 cells. MM#3 expressed a larger amount of SNAIL, SLUG, SOX9, vimentin and Twist in comparison to both parental cell lines. Therefore, no E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 were detectable. MH#7 and MH#9 also expressed more SNAIL, SOX9 and vimentin compared to both parental cell lines. Both MH-hybrid clones were negative for E-cadherin, N-cadherin and ZEB1 ( Figure 5 b).\n2.5. Analysis of Signaling Kinetics\nLikewise, the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), HER3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was also analyzed. While the expression of EGFR and HER2 was detectable for all cell lines, only MM#2 expressed HER3 ( Figure 6 a).\nTo analyze which signaling pathway may be active in the hybrid cells, cells were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 1, 2 or 5 min. Afterward, Western blot analysis was used to investigate if phosphorylated Akt and/or Erk1/2 is expressed ( Figure 6 b). Nonphosphorylated Akt was detectable in all cell lines except in iMSC#3 cells upon stimulation with EGF. Non-phosphorylated Erk1/2 was expressed by all cell lines, but in iMSC#3 and MH#9 cells, the amount seemed to be lower in stimulated cells compared to unstimulated cells. In iMSC#3, MDA-MB-231 Hyg, MM#2 and MM#3 cells, no phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) was detectable, while in HS578T Hyg, MH#7 and MH#9 cells, the amount of pAkt increased in accordance with EGF exposure time.", " Likewise, increasing amounts of phosphorylated Erk1/2 (pErk1/2) were seen in iMSC#3, HS578T Hyg and MH#7 cells, while the amount of pErk1/2 in the other cells was constant or even decreasing in accordance with the time of EGF treatment time. These results match the previous results regarding the mixed capacities hybrid cells gained from their parental cells.\n2.6. Cytotoxicity Tests\nTo test whether the hybrid clones react differently to cytostatic drugs, XTT analysis was performed using either paclitaxel or doxorubicin at concentrations of 0.1 \u00b5M/1 \u00b5M/10 \u00b5M. In brief, all cell lines died quickly after treatment with paclitaxel. Similar findings were observed after treatment with doxorubicin for iMSC#3, HS578T Hyg, and MM#2 cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 Hyg, MM#3, MH#7 and MH#9 cells exhibited resistance against doxorubicin at a concentration of 0.1 \u00b5M ( Figure 7 a,b).\n"]}
{"doc_key": "7765946_1. Introduction", "text": ["\nBreast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, and the second most frequent overall [ 1 ]. This disease can be caused by a variety of factors concerning lifestyle, the art of living, habitation, family background and genetic variations, to name a few [ 1 ]. The complexity of BC is one reason why treatment is particularly difficult and needs multidisciplinary investigations [ 2 ]. The very fact that BC can be separated into different subtypes relating to the histology, the genetic hormone receptor status and the invasiveness underlines this aspect. Tumor heterogeneity is a huge problem, as are metastasis and recurrences. Unfortunately, there still is little known about how and why these phenomena occur.\nIn this context, so-called cancer stem/initiating cells (CS/ICs) came to the forefront of research. CS/ICs are thought to be the reason for cancer recurrences, but also for tumor invasion and resistance against chemotherapy and radiation treatment [ 3 ]. They are mainly distinguished by their ability to self-renew as well as to differentiate. Many hypotheses have been made about the origin of CS/ICs. It was demonstrated that different factors might be responsible for the formation of CS/ICs, including differentiation of adult stem cells into CS/ICs [ 4 ] and differentiation of non-CS/ICs into CS/ICs by mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer, metabolic shifts and cell fusion [ 3 ]. Because of these different possible origins, CS/ICs show phenotypic plasticity leading to a heterogeneous cell population, making it difficult to define CS/IC characteristics [ 5 ]. There are also processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoting this state [ 6 ]. In this study, we wanted to focus on cell fusion and to determine if cell fusion hybrid cells gain CSC characteristics.\nCell fusion is a rare but very important process found in physiological processes, including tissue regeneration [ 7 ], fertilization [ 8 ], and muscle development or osteogenesis [ 9 ], as well as in pathophysiological contexts such as viral infection [ 10 ]. It was demonstrated by different working groups that fused cells could be found within a solid tumor [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] and in the circulating blood [ 14 , 15 , 16 ]. These newly gained hybrid cells exhibited different characteristics than the parental cells. Xu et al. showed that hybrid cells derived from the fusion of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and three different lung cancer cell lines (A549, H460 and SK-MES-1) exhibited an increased tumorigenic potential when the cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Fused cells gave rise to larger tumors and additionally produced tumors more efficiently than the respective parental lung cancer cells [ 17 ]. In a different study, Mi et al. demonstrated that the metastatic potential of tumor \u00d7 tumor hybrid cells was increased compared to unfused, parental tumor cells [ 18 ]. Likewise, altered resistance to radiation and chemotherapy was also seen in hybrid cells [ 19 , 20 ]. The fusion of cancer cells with cell lines exhibiting a mesenchymal phenotype, such as leukocytes or mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, may lead to a gain of function within cancer cells, afterward exhibiting the ability to migrate.\nIn previous studies, we demonstrated that hybrid cells, generated by spontaneous cell fusion of human breast epithelial M13SV1-EGFP-Neo cells and different breast cancer cell lines (HS578T Hyg; MDA-MB-231 Hyg; MDA-MB-435 Hyg), exhibited individual stem cell and/or tumorigenic characteristics. M13MDA435 hybrids, for example, showed increased migratory activity and different resistance capabilities compared to the parental cell lines [ 7 ]. A variety of stem cell properties, such as the formation of mammospheres or the number of ALDH1-positive cells, had been demonstrated for M13HS hybrid cells [ 21 ]. In addition to these results, we concluded that hybrid properties were extremely dependent on parental cell characteristics [ 22 ]. To amplify this hypothesis, we generated hybrid cells by spontaneous fusion of immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC#3) and either MDA-MB-231 Hyg or HS578T Hyg breast cancer cells. iMSC#3 cells are telomerase-immortalized, nontumorigenic and can be cultured for a long time [ 23 ]. It was previously reported that MSCs could be found in primary breast cancer tissues and that these cells impact the proliferation and mammosphere formation of MCF7 cells [ 24 ]. Here, we investigated different stem cell (SC)/CS/IC characteristics such as the number of ALDH1-positive cells, the formation of colonies and mammospheres, and different markers using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. In short, we could confirm that hybrid cells exhibit an individual phenotype and that this phenotype is dependent on parental cell line characteristics.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 14, "DISEASE"], [16, 18, "DISEASE"], [53, 59, "DISEASE"], [299, 301, "DISEASE"], [425, 427, "DISEASE"], [762, 768, "DISEASE"], [875, 881, "DISEASE"], [2480, 2486, "DISEASE"], [2736, 2747, "DISEASE"], [3204, 3210, "DISEASE"], [3419, 3432, "DISEASE"], [3796, 3801, "GENE"]], [[4167, 4180, "DISEASE"], [4352, 4365, "DISEASE"], [4559, 4564, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], []], "triplets": [[], []], "triplets_text": [[], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nBreast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, and the second most frequent overall [ 1 ].

{"doc_key": "3984243_Discussion", "text": ["\nThe EGF family is composed of an interacting network of receptors and ligands that must be considered as a whole to understand the regulation of signaling in the EGF family. We determined the regulation pattern of the EGF family in tumor tissue from patients with gastric cancer as well as the matched adjacent normal tissue from the same patients.\nWe found the signaling potential of EGFR to be upregulated in the tumor tissue through upregulation of all the EGFR activating ligands, and we also found upregulation of HER2 in tumor tissue that was very close to being significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.0520). This is in good agreement with existing data that show that both EGFR and HER2 are associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer  [19] . The importance of HER2 in gastric cancer is demonstrated by the fact that the HER2 inhibiting antibody Herceptin is the only approved agent for targeted treatment of gastric cancer  [24] .\nFor HER3, we did not observe any expressional regulation on the mRNA level. However, a few studies on HER3 in gastric cancer have ascribed a role for HER3 in gastric cancer. HER3 has been associated with poor survival, and positive HER3 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 18.6% of gastric cancer samples compared to only 2.0% of nontumorous samples  [25] - [27] . We did not find a higher HER3 expression in gastric cancer compared to normal tissue in our study. However, a difference in the methods used in the studies (immunohistochemistry vs RT-qPCR) might account for some of the discrepancies in the results. In addition, we were able to describe the regulation pattern in each patient rather than in a pool of cancer patients and a pool of control persons, and this could also account for a difference in the results obtained in the two studies.\nWe found a marked downregulation of both HER4 and its activating ligand NRG4 in tumor tissue. Our results are strengthened by the fact that we also found a downregulation when we used additional assays to quantify the specific isoforms of HER4. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that normal gastric tissue is positive for HER4, whereas cancerous tissue has very low or no HER4 staining.\nThe decreased expression of HER4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue can be ascribed to a decrease in the number of cells expressing HER4 or to a decrease in HER4 expression in all the HER4 expressing cells. From our immunohistochemical stainings, we observe that in the gastric cancers only minor clusters with tumor cells had a positive immunoreaction to HER4, whereas the vast majority of tumor cells were completely negative. This indicates that it is the number of cell that expresses HER4 that is decreased in the tumors. In contrast to the tumor tissue, the normal tissue had very strong immunoreactions to HER4. Interestingly, it is especially mucus-producing cells and hydrochloric acid-producing parietal cell that express HER4 protein.\nThe role of HER4 in cancerous disease is controversial. In bladder cancer, RT-qPCR quantification of HER4 and its ligands show that HER4 is associated with better survival. In particular, the co-expression of HER4 together with its specific ligand, NRG4, is highly correlated with better survival  [28] . Likewise, HER4 is associated with better overall and disease-free survival in cervix cancer  [29] . In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, HER4 is lost in late stage tumors  [30] , and HER4 is mainly found in low-stage and non-metastatic xenograft tumors in pancreatic cancer  [31] .\nOn the other hand, HER4 protein expression as determined by immunohistochemistry has been associated with distal metastasis and a decreased survival rate in oral squamous cell carcinomas  [32] . In a study of colorectal cancer in which the protein expression pattern was also determined by immunohistochemistry, early-stage patients had a lower percentage of HER4 overexpression than late-stage patients  [33] . In malignancies of the central nervous system, HER4 also possesses a tumor-promoting role  [34] ,  [35] .\nNot much is known about the role of HER4 in gastric cancer. No HER4 mRNA expression was detected in two gastric cancer cell lines  [36] . HER4 protein expression as detected by immunohistochemistry has been found to correlate with early stage, lower grade, and absence of lymph node metastases in gastric cancer  [25] . This is in very good agreement with another study that investigated gene expression profiles in long-term survivors from metastatic gastric cancer treated with chemotherapy in which the authors indicated a possible role of HER4 upregulation in these patients  [37] . Together with our present results, these data further indicate that HER4 signaling has a protective function against carcinogenesis in the gastric region. One study found the HER4 gene to be frequently amplified in gastric cancer  [38] . However, the results of our studies indicate that this does not translate to the HER4 expression level since we found a downregulation of HER4 mRNA and protein expression rather than an upregulation.\nEven though we did not find the expression of EGFR to be regulated, the signaling potential through this receptor is increased by the upregulation of all its ligands. This includes the ligands shared with HER4: HB-EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin. In addition to autocrine EGFR activation, upregulation of these ligands potentially results in increased activity of HER4. Activation of the EGFR pathway is indeed a way for the cells to become increasingly carcinogenic. However, considering HER4 to have anti-carcinogenic functions, a concomitant activation of this receptor would halt the proliferative advantage of EGFR activation. One could speculate that this potential activation of HER4 is avoided by the concomitant downregulation of the receptor and its specific ligand NRG4.\nIn patients with bladder cancer, the combined HER4/NRG4 signaling unit can be growth inhibitory, and the co-expression of HER4 together with NRG4 is highly correlated to better survival if the two proteins act together rather than individually  [28] .\nWe have also performed an analysis to compare the HER4 expression to patient survival. We did observe a trend towards high HER4 expression being correlated to a better survival (results not shown), however, due to a limitation in the number of patients included in the study, this result was not found to be significant and further studies will have to elucidate if a correlation between HER4 expression and survival can be found in gastric cancer. A correlation of the expression level of the EGF receptors to the presence of lymph node metastases and the tumor invasiveness showed only HER2 to correlate inversely to these parameters whereas no correlation was found for the remaining EGF family (results not shown).\nIn conclusion, our results suggest a new role for HER4 in gastric cancer. Interestingly, we found both HER4 and its specific ligand NRG4 to be downregulated in cancerous tissue. This is accompanied by an increased signaling potential of EGFR through upregulation of all its ligands and an upregulation of HER2.\n"], "ner": [[[265, 279, "DISEASE"], [386, 390, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [520, 524, "GENE"], [661, 665, "GENE"], [670, 674, "GENE"], [695, 709, "RELATION"], [713, 727, "DISEASE"], [754, 758, "GENE"], [762, 776, "DISEASE"], [814, 818, "GENE"], [880, 898, "RELATION"], [902, 916, "DISEASE"], [929, 933, "GENE"], [1027, 1031, "GENE"], [1035, 1049, "DISEASE"], [1066, 1070, "RELATION"], [1075, 1079, "GENE"], [1083, 1097, "DISEASE"], [1099, 1103, "GENE"], [[1148, 1162], [1156, 1180], "RELATION"], [1157, 1161, "GENE"], [1230, 1244, "DISEASE"], [1338, 1342, "GENE"], [1357, 1371, "DISEASE"], [1665, 1671, "DISEASE"], [1842, 1846, "GENE"], [1873, 1877, "GENE"], [2040, 2044, "GENE"], [2130, 2134, "GENE"], [2180, 2184, "GENE"], [2223, 2227, "GENE"], [2328, 2332, "GENE"], [2353, 2357, "GENE"], [2380, 2384, "GENE"], [2466, 2480, "DISEASE"], [2552, 2556, "GENE"], [2685, 2689, "GENE"], [2809, 2813, "GENE"], [2928, 2932, "GENE"], [2954, 2958, "GENE"], [3001, 3015, "DISEASE"], [3043, 3047, "GENE"], [3074, 3078, "GENE"], [3098, 3113, "RELATION"], [3151, 3155, "GENE"], [3191, 3195, "GENE"], [3223, 3238, "RELATION"], [3257, 3261, "GENE"], [3281, 3321, "RELATION"], [3325, 3338, "DISEASE"], [3350, 3383, "DISEASE"], [3385, 3389, "GENE"], [3431, 3435, "GENE"], [3504, 3521, "DISEASE"], [3549, 3553, "GENE"], [3660, 3683, "RELATION"], [3687, 3716, "DISEASE"], [3739, 3756, "DISEASE"], [3889, 3893, "GENE"], [3894, 3908, "RELATION"], [3989, 3993, "GENE"]], [[4076, 4080, "RELATION"], [4084, 4088, "GENE"], [4092, 4106, "DISEASE"], [[4108, 4116], [4110, 4131], "RELATION"], [4111, 4115, "GENE"], [4152, 4166, "DISEASE"], [4186, 4190, "GENE"], [4345, 4359, "DISEASE"], [4500, 4514, "DISEASE"], [4591, 4595, "GENE"], [4596, 4608, "RELATION"], [4703, 4707, "GENE"], [4810, 4814, "GENE"], [4850, 4864, "DISEASE"], [4954, 4958, "GENE"], [5011, 5015, "GENE"], [5119, 5123, "GENE"], [5278, 5282, "GENE"], [5287, 5290, "GENE"], [5292, 5304, "GENE"], [5310, 5320, "GENE"], [5347, 5351, "GENE"], [5439, 5443, "GENE"], [5463, 5467, "GENE"], [5564, 5568, "GENE"], [5690, 5694, "GENE"], [5761, 5765, "GENE"], [5851, 5855, "GENE"], [5874, 5888, "DISEASE"], [5903, 5907, "GENE"], [5908, 5912, "GENE"], [5979, 5983, "GENE"], [5998, 6002, "GENE"], [6027, 6042, "RELATION"], [6159, 6163, "GENE"], [6232, 6236, "GENE"], [6497, 6501, "GENE"], [6542, 6556, "DISEASE"], [6697, 6701, "GENE"], [6869, 6873, "RELATION"], [6878, 6882, "GENE"], [6886, 6900, "DISEASE"], [6931, 6935, "GENE"], [6960, 6964, "GENE"], [7065, 7069, "GENE"], [7133, 7137, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[661, 665, 713, 727, "negative prognostic marker"], [670, 674, 713, 727, "negative prognostic marker"], [814, 818, 902, 916, "therapeutic target"], [1075, 1079, 1083, 1097, "relation undefined"], [1157, 1161, 1230, 1244, "increased expression"], [3074, 3078, 3001, 3015, "positive prognostic marker"], [3257, 3261, 3325, 3338, "positive prognostic marker"], [3549, 3553, 3687, 3716, "negative prognostic marker"], [3889, 3893, 3739, 3756, "increased expression"]], [[4084, 4088, 4092, 4106, "relation undefined"], [4111, 4115, 4152, 4166, "decreased expression"], [4591, 4595, 4500, 4514, "increased expression"], [5979, 5983, 5874, 5888, "positive prognostic marker"], [5998, 6002, 5874, 5888, "positive prognostic marker"], [6878, 6882, 6886, 6900, "relation undefined"]]], "triplets": [[[661, 665, 713, 727, 695, 709], [670, 674, 713, 727, 695, 709], [814, 818, 902, 916, 880, 898], [1075, 1079, 1083, 1097, 1066, 1070], [1157, 1161, 1230, 1244, [1148, 1162], [1156, 1180]], [3074, 3078, 3001, 3015, 3098, 3113], [3257, 3261, 3325, 3338, 3281, 3321], [3549, 3553, 3687, 3716, 3660, 3683], [3889, 3893, 3739, 3756, 3894, 3908]], [[4084, 4088, 4092, 4106, 4076, 4080], [4111, 4115, 4152, 4166, [4108, 4116], [4110, 4131]], [4591, 4595, 4500, 4514, 4596, 4608], [5979, 5983, 5874, 5888, 6027, 6042], [5998, 6002, 5874, 5888, 6027, 6042], [6878, 6882, 6886, 6900, 6869, 6873]]], "triplets_text": [[["EGFR", "gastric cancer", "poor prognosis"], ["HER2", "gastric cancer", "poor prognosis"], ["HER2", "gastric cancer", "targeted treatment"], ["HER3", "gastric cancer", "role"], ["HER3", "gastric cancer", "positive protein expression"], ["HER4", "bladder cancer", "better survival"], ["HER4", "cervix cancer", "better overall and disease -

We determined the regulation pattern of the EGF family in tumor tissue from patients with gastric cancer as well as the matched adjacent normal tissue from the same patients.\nWe found the signaling potential of EGFR to be upregulated in the tumor tissue through upregulation of all the EGFR activating ligands, and we also found upregulation of HER2 in tumor tissue that was very close to being significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.0520). This is in good agreement with existing data that show that both EGFR and HER2 are associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer  [19] . The importance of HER2 in gastric cancer is demonstrated by the fact that the HER2 inhibiting antibody Herceptin is the only approved agent for targeted treatment of gastric cancer  [24] .\nFor HER3, we did not observe any expressional regulation on the mRNA level. However, a few studies on HER3 in gastric cancer have ascribed a role for HER3 in gastric cancer. HER3 has been associated with poor survival, and positive HER3 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 18.6% of gastric cancer samples compared to only 2.0% of nontumorous samples  [25] - [27] . We did not find a higher HER3 expression in gastric cancer compared to normal tissue in our study. However, a difference in the methods used in the studies (immunohistochemistry vs RT-qPCR) might account for some of the discrepancies in the results. In addition, we were able to describe the regulation pattern in each patient rather than in a pool of cancer patients and a pool of control persons, and this could also account for a difference in the results obtained in the two studies.\nWe found a marked downregulation of both HER4 and its activating ligand NRG4 in tumor tissue. Our results are strengthened by the fact that we also found a downregulation when we used additional assays to quantify the specific isoforms of HER4. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that normal gastric tissue is positive for HER4, whereas cancerous tissue has very low or no HER4 staining.\nThe decreased expression of HER4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue can be ascribed to a decrease in the number of cells expressing HER4 or to a decrease in HER4 expression in all the HER4 expressing cells. From our immunohistochemical stainings, we observe that in the gastric cancers only minor clusters with tumor cells had a positive immunoreaction to HER4, whereas the vast majority of tumor cells were completely negative. This indicates that it is the number of cell that expresses HER4 that is decreased in the tumors. In contrast to the tumor tissue, the normal tissue had very strong immunoreactions to HER4. Interestingly, it is especially mucus-producing cells and hydrochloric acid-producing parietal cell that express HER4 protein.\nThe role of HER4 in cancerous disease is controversial. In bladder cancer, RT-qPCR quantification of HER4 and its ligands show that HER4 is associated with better survival. In particular, the co-expression of HER4 together with its specific ligand, NRG4, is highly correlated with better survival  [28] . Likewise, HER4 is associated with better overall and disease-free survival in cervix cancer  [29] . In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, HER4 is lost in late stage tumors  [30] , and HER4 is mainly found in low-stage and non-metastatic xenograft tumors in pancreatic cancer  [31] .\nOn the other hand, HER4 protein expression as determined by immunohistochemistry has been associated with distal metastasis and a decreased survival rate in oral squamous cell carcinomas  [32] . In a study of colorectal cancer in which the protein expression pattern was also determined by immunohistochemistry, early-stage patients had a lower percentage of HER4 overexpression than late-stage patients  [33] . In malignancies of the central nervous system, HER4 also p", "ossesses a tumor-promoting role  [34] ,  [35] .\nNot much is known about the role of HER4 in gastric cancer. No HER4 mRNA expression was detected in two gastric cancer cell lines  [36] . HER4 protein expression as detected by immunohistochemistry has been found to correlate with early stage, lower grade, and absence of lymph node metastases in gastric cancer  [25] . This is in very good agreement with another study that investigated gene expression profiles in long-term survivors from metastatic gastric cancer treated with chemotherapy in which the authors indicated a possible role of HER4 upregulation in these patients  [37] . Together with our present results, these data further indicate that HER4 signaling has a protective function against carcinogenesis in the gastric region. One study found the HER4 gene to be frequently amplified in gastric cancer  [38] . However, the results of our studies indicate that this does not translate to the HER4 expression level since we found a downregulation of HER4 mRNA and protein expression rather than an upregulation.\nEven though we did not find the expression of EGFR to be regulated, the signaling potential through this receptor is increased by the upregulation of all its ligands. This includes the ligands shared with HER4: HB-EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin. In addition to autocrine EGFR activation, upregulation of these ligands potentially results in increased activity of HER4. Activation of the EGFR pathway is indeed a way for the cells to become increasingly carcinogenic. However, considering HER4 to have anti-carcinogenic functions, a concomitant activation of this receptor would halt the proliferative advantage of EGFR activation. One could speculate that this potential activation of HER4 is avoided by the concomitant downregulation of the receptor and its specific ligand NRG4.\nIn patients with bladder cancer, the combined HER4/NRG4 signaling unit can be growth inhibitory, and the co-expression of HER4 together with NRG4 is highly correlated to better survival if the two proteins act together rather than individually  [28] .\nWe have also performed an analysis to compare the HER4 expression to patient survival.

RNA from tissue was isolated according to the manufacture's protocol for Trizol RNA isolation (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA concentrations were measured on a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. RNA quality was tested on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacture's protocol.\nReverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-q-PCR)\ncDNA was synthesized from 1 ug total RNA using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The final reaction was diluted to a total volume of 200 uL.\n1 \u00b5l of cDNA was used for qPCR using SYBR green Master mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on a Roche lightcycler 480 at: 95\u00b0C, 10 min; 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, specific annealing temperature for 10 sec, 72\u00b0C for 5 sec; 99\u00b0C for 1 sec; 59\u00b0C for 15 sec; 95\u00b0C for 1 sec; cooling to 40\u00b0C.

SDHA turned out to be the best of the five. Two samples were excluded from the analyses due to no detection of mRNA from any of the reference genes.\nImmunostaining\nParaffin-embedded tissues fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde from 13 representative patients were investigated by immunohistochemistry using c-erbB-4/HER-4, rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1/50 as the primary antibody (RB-9045-P1, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). For antigen retrieval sections were boiled in micro wave oven in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The immunoreaction was visualized by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1/200 (BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), followed by a preformed avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex (ABC) diluted 1/100 (Code nr. PK-4000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The reaction was developed by the use of 3,3 -diaminobenzidine and counterstaining was performed with Mayer's Hemalum. As a negative control, the same procedure was conducted without any primary antibody.\nUsing Image Pro Plus (MediaCybernetics) the staining intensity of representative images of the tumor versus the surrounding mucosa tissue was estimated. Two images of tumor sample and two images of the surrounding mucosa were collected from each tissue sample and the average of the two values was calculated and used for statistical analysis and plotting. For a few samples, only tumor tissue or only normal mucosa was present and no comparison of HER4 expression was possible for these tissues. Paired t-test was used to determine if the intensity of the tumor tissues was different from the intensity of the mucosa tissues.\n"], "ner": [[[103, 132, "DISEASE"], [[103, 147], [124, 172], "DISEASE"], [[103, 134], [124, 143], "DISEASE"]], [[4381, 4385, "GENE"], [4567, 4571, "GENE"], [4764, 4768, "GENE"], [4927, 4931, "GENE"], [5124, 5128, "GENE"], [5333, 5337, "GENE"], [5530, 5534, "GENE"], [5747, 5751, "GENE"], [5949, 5953, "GENE"], [6146, 6149, "GENE"], [6350, 6356, "GENE"], [6738, 6741, "GENE"], [6923, 6926, "GENE"], [7117, 7122, "GENE"], [7334, 7339, "GENE"], [7523, 7531, "GENE"], [7718, 7723, "GENE"]], [[7907, 7915, "GENE"], [8098, 8102, "GENE"], [8291, 8295, "GENE"], [8488, 8492, "GENE"], [8904, 8909, "GENE"], [8911, 8921, "GENE"], [[8923, 8930], [8928, 8934], "GENE"], [8940, 8944, "GENE"], [8946, 8950, "GENE"], [9256, 9262, "GENE"], [9263, 9268, "GENE"], [10456, 10460, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2], "sentences": ["\nPatient selection and collection of biopsies\nIn this cohort study, 38 patients undergoing surgery for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagus or gastroesophageal junction were consecutively included from July 2008 to November 2009. All individuals provided an informed written consent. Collection of biopsies was approved by the regional scientific ethics committees of Zealand, Denmark (journal number H-B-2008-049), and the establishment of a biobank was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (journal number 2008-41-2138).

SDHA turned out to be the best of the five. Two samples were excluded from the analyses due to no detection of mRNA from any of the reference genes.\nImmunostaining\nParaffin-embedded tissues fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde from 13 representative patients were investigated by immunohistochemistry using c-erbB-4/HER-4, rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted 1/50 as the primary antibody (RB-9045-P1, Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). For antigen retrieval sections were boiled in micro wave oven in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The immunoreaction was visualized by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted 1/200 (BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), followed by a preformed avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex (ABC) diluted 1/100 (Code nr. PK-4000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The reaction was developed by the use of 3,3 -diaminobenzidine and counterstaining was performed with Mayer's Hemalum. As a negative control, the same procedure was conducted without any primary antibody.\nUsing Image Pro Plus (MediaCybernetics) the staining intensity of representative images of the tumor versus the surrounding mucosa tissue was estimated. Two images of tumor sample and two images of the surrounding mucosa were collected from each tissue sample and the average of the two values was calculated and used for statistical analysis and plotting. For a few samples, only tumor tissue or only normal mucosa was present and no comparison of HER4 expression was possible for these tissues. Paired t-test was used to determine if the intensity of the tumor tissues was different from the intensity of the mucosa tissues.\n"]}

The mRNA expression of the four EGF family receptors EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4 is depicted in  Figure 1 . Interestingly, the HER4 receptor was subjected to downregulation in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue (p\u200a=\u200a0.0004). For HER2, we saw an upregulation of this receptor in the cancerous tissue that was very close to being significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.0520). EGFR and HER3 mRNA expression was un-changed in the tumors compared to the normal tissue.\nHER4 exists as different alternatively spliced isoforms. The juxtamembranous region can consist of either JMa or JMb, and the cytoplasmic region can consist of either CYT1 or CYT2. The downregulation observed for total HER4 mRNA expression in cancerous tissue applied to all four variants of the receptor ( Figure 2 ).\nTo better illustrate the magnitude of HER4 downregulation in the tumor tissue, we plotted the HER4 down- or upregulation for each individual patient. The HER4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue minus the HER4 mRNA expression in the matched normal tissue (DeltaHER4) is depicted in  Figure 3 . A value below 0 represents a downregulation. This figure clearly illustrates that HER4 downregulation is a very general mechanism that takes place in the majority of the patients and regardless of tumor localization.\nmRNA expression of the EGF family ligands in gastric cancer\nTGF-\u03b1, amphiregulin, and EGF specifically bind EGFR. A negligible mRNA expression level was detected for EGF in both tumor and normal tissue, and therefore this ligand was not considered for further analysis. TGF-\u03b1 and amphiregulin were both upregulated in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue ( Figures 4a and b ). HB-EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin have affinity for both EGFR and HER4, and all of these ligands were also upregulated in the cancerous tissue ( Figures 4  c, d, and e). Taken together, this shows that all EGFR-activating ligands are upregulated in the tumors.\nOf the neuregulins, NRG1 and NRG2 bind both HER3 and HER4. We observed no change in expression of either the \u03b1 or the beta variants of NRG1 and NRG2 ( Figures 4f, g, h and i ). NRG3 and NRG4 only bind HER4. NRG3 did not undergo any change in expression from normal to cancerous tissue ( Figure 4j ). However, NRG4 was downregulated in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue (p\u200a=\u200a0.0009) ( Figure 4k ). This demonstrates that both HER4 and its specific ligand NRG4 are down-regulated in gastric cancer.\nTo better illustrate the magnitude of NRG4 downregulation in the tumor tissue, we plotted the NRG4 down- or upregulation for each individual patient. The NRG4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue minus the NRG4 mRNA expression in the matched normal tissue (DeltaNRG4) is depicted in  Figure 5 .\nConsidering all the patients showing downregulation of total HER4 in their tumor tissue, in 82% of these NRG4 was also downregulation and in 86% one or more of the EGFR-shared ligands (HB-EGF, epiregulin, betacellulin) was upregulated. In 36% of the patients with total HER4 downregulation, all three of the EGFR shared ligands were upregulated.\nProtein expression of HER by immunohistochemistry\nBecause of post-transcriptional regulations, the mRNA expression patterns determined by RT-qPCR might not represent the protein expression pattern. To ensure that the observed decrease in HER4 mRNA expression in the cancerous tissue of patients with gastric cancer is also reflected on the protein level, we performed immunohistochemical staining on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from all patients included in the study.\nBy a quantification of the HER4 staining intensity in representative areas of the tumor- and the surrounding tissue, we found the tumor tissue to have significantly less HER4 staining intensity compared to the surrounding normal mucosa (p\u200a=\u200a0.0029) ( Figure 6 ).\nRepresentative photomicrographs of the stainings are presented in  Figure 7 . In the normal gastric mucosa there was a strong HER4 immunoreaction ( Figure 7  a). Especially the basal part of the cytoplasm and the lateral cell membrane of the surface epithelial cells were strongly immunoreactive for HER4 ( Figure 5  b). Also the parietal cells showed very strong HER4 immunoreactivity ( Figure 7  c and d). The submucosa and muscle layers were negative.

The mRNA expression of the four EGF family receptors EGFR, HER2, HER3, and HER4 is depicted in  Figure 1 . Interestingly, the HER4 receptor was subjected to downregulation in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue (p\u200a=\u200a0.0004). For HER2, we saw an upregulation of this receptor in the cancerous tissue that was very close to being significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.0520). EGFR and HER3 mRNA expression was un-changed in the tumors compared to the normal tissue.\nHER4 exists as different alternatively spliced isoforms. The juxtamembranous region can consist of either JMa or JMb, and the cytoplasmic region can consist of either CYT1 or CYT2. The downregulation observed for total HER4 mRNA expression in cancerous tissue applied to all four variants of the receptor ( Figure 2 ).\nTo better illustrate the magnitude of HER4 downregulation in the tumor tissue, we plotted the HER4 down- or upregulation for each individual patient. The HER4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue minus the HER4 mRNA expression in the matched normal tissue (DeltaHER4) is depicted in  Figure 3 . A value below 0 represents a downregulation. This figure clearly illustrates that HER4 downregulation is a very general mechanism that takes place in the majority of the patients and regardless of tumor localization.\nmRNA expression of the EGF family ligands in gastric cancer\nTGF-\u03b1, amphiregulin, and EGF specifically bind EGFR. A negligible mRNA expression level was detected for EGF in both tumor and normal tissue, and therefore this ligand was not considered for further analysis. TGF-\u03b1 and amphiregulin were both upregulated in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue ( Figures 4a and b ). HB-EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin have affinity for both EGFR and HER4, and all of these ligands were also upregulated in the cancerous tissue ( Figures 4  c, d, and e). Taken together, this shows that all EGFR-activating ligands are upregulated in the tumors.\nOf the neuregulins, NRG1 and NRG2 bind both HER3 and HER4. We observed no change in expression of either the \u03b1 or the beta variants of NRG1 and NRG2 ( Figures 4f, g, h and i ). NRG3 and NRG4 only bind HER4. NRG3 did not undergo any change in expression from normal to cancerous tissue ( Figure 4j ). However, NRG4 was downregulated in the cancerous tissue compared to the normal tissue (p\u200a=\u200a0.0009) ( Figure 4k ). This demonstrates that both HER4 and its specific ligand NRG4 are down-regulated in gastric cancer.\nTo better illustrate the magnitude of NRG4 downregulation in the tumor tissue, we plotted the NRG4 down- or upregulation for each individual patient. The NRG4 mRNA expression in the tumor tissue minus the NRG4 mRNA expression in the matched normal tissue (DeltaNRG4) is depicted in  Figure 5 .\nConsidering all the patients showing downregulation of total HER4 in their tumor tissue, in 82% of these NRG4 was also downregulation and in 86% one or more of the EGFR-shared ligands (HB-EGF, epiregulin, betacellulin) was upregulated. In 36% of the patients with total HER4 downregulation, all three of the EGFR shared ligands were upregulated.\nProtein expression of HER by immunohistochemistry\nBecause of post-transcriptional regulations, the mRNA expression patterns determined by RT-qPCR might not represent the protein expression pattern. To ensure that the observed decrease in HER4 mRNA expression in the cancerous tissue of patients with gastric cancer is also reflected on the protein level, we performed immunohistochemical staining on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from all patients included in the study.\nBy a quantification of the HER4 staining intensity in representative areas of the tumor- and the surrounding tissue, we found the tumor tissue to have significantly less HER4 staining intensit", "y compared to the surrounding normal mucosa (p\u200a=\u200a0.0029) ( Figure 6 ).\nRepresentative photomicrographs of the stainings are presented in  Figure 7 . In the normal gastric mucosa there was a strong HER4 immunoreaction ( Figure 7  a). Especially the basal part of the cytoplasm and the lateral cell membrane of the surface epithelial cells were strongly immunoreactive for HER4 ( Figure 5  b). Also the parietal cells showed very strong HER4 immunoreactivity ( Figure 7  c and d). The submucosa and muscle layers were negative. In the glandular structures especially the parietal cells showed very strong HER4 immunoreactivity ( Figures 7  c and d). Negative controls performed without any primary antibody resulted in no staining.\nIn the gastric cancers only minor areas with tumor cells had a positive immunoreaction to HER4, and the negative tumor tissue contrasted strongly with the stained normal mucosa adjacent to the tumor ( Figure 7 ). In the central parts of the tumor tissue almost all cells were completely negative apart from small clusters of cells which might have had a distinct membrane staining.\n"]}

PD diagnosis was confirmed by experienced clinical psychologists on the basis of a clinical interview according to DSM-IV criteria (SCID-I; Wittchen et al.  1997 ). The presence of current comorbid axis I diagnoses other than bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, current alcohol dependence, current abuse of or dependence on benzodiazepines and other psychoactive substances was tolerated if PD was the primary diagnosis (MDD:  N  = 28; social anxiety disorder:  N  = 3; specific phobias:  N  = 2). Further exclusion criteria were current or past internal or neurological somatic illnesses, intake of any somatic medication, illegal drugs including cannabis (assessed by urine toxicology), pregnancy and excessive alcohol (> 15 glasses of alcohol per week) or nicotine (> 20 cigarettes per day) consumption. Thirty-four (56.7%) patients were on stable psychiatric medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,  N  = 18), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs,  N  = 5), a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA,  N  = 7), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs,  N  = 7), pregabaline ( N  = 2), quetiapine ( N  = 2), or zopiclone ( N  = 1). No patient received monoamine oxidase inhibitors or valproate. Smoking status was assessed in the patient (smokers:  N  = 19) and control groups ( N  = 18). In the control group, absence of current and/or lifetime DSM-IV mental axis I disorders was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.; Sheehan et al.  1998 ). The severity of depressive symptoms in patients was assessed using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Hautziger et al.  2009 ). All participants were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry, University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, within the Collaborative Research Centre SFB-TRR-58 'Fear, Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders', project C02.\n  comprised 170 Caucasian patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD; 98 females; age [mean \u00b1 SD]: 44.61 \u00b1 14.86 years) with (\u2265 7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; cf. Fava et al.  2008 ; Domschke et al.  2010 ;  N  = 99, 58.24%) or without anxious depression. MDD diagnosis was determined by experienced clinical psychologists or psychiatrists based on medical records and a structured clinical interview according to DSM-IV criteria (SCID-I; Wittchen et al.  1997 ). Exclusion criteria were current obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis or dementia, and/or presence of substance abuse disorder or eating disorder currently or within the last 10 years. Smoking status was assessed in the overall sample (smokers:  N  = 52, 30.59%).  N  = 135 (79.4%) patients received psychiatric medication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,  N  = 48), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs,  N  = 48), a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA,  N  = 36), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs,  N  = 26), a noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI,  N  = 6), neuroleptics ( N  = 33), anticonvulsants ( N  = 12), benzodiazepines ( N  = 13), lithium ( N  = 7), or tianeptine ( N  = 1). No patient received monoamine oxidase inhibitors or valproate. All participants were recruited at the Department of Psychiatry, University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany.\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, and was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n  DNA methylation analysis\nVenous blood samples were collected from all participants using standardized EDTA tubes. DNA extractions from frozen whole blood were accomplished using either FlexiGene \u00ae  DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or a standardized salting out procedure (Miller et al.  1988 ). After pre-analysis of a 313 bp-long  KLF11  promoter region (chr2:10,182,891-10,183,204; GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser) by Sanger sequencing (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany) according to previous studies (e.g., Domschke et al.  2012 ; Ziegler et al.  2016 ; Schiele et al.  2018 ,  2019 ,  2020 ), a 72 bp amplicon containing part of the  KLF11  promoter (five CpGs) upstream of exon I (chr2:10,183,094-10,183,166; GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser) was chosen for further DNA methylation analyses, given that only these five CpG sites showed a considerable variance in their mean methylation level and thus seemed to be suitable for subsequent DNA methylation analyses by pyrosequencing.\nAliquots (500 ng) of isolated genomic DNA were treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect \u00ae  96 Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and processed in randomized order to avoid possible batch effects. Non-methylated and fully methylated EpiTect \u00ae  PCR Control DNA Sets (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used as a control for successful bisulfite conversion.\nThe 72 bp amplicon (10,183,094-10,183,166; GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser) was amplified via PCR according to a standard pyrosequencing PCR protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The obtained DNA strand was sequenced and quantitatively analyzed by pyrosequencing using PyroMark \u00ae  Q96 ID System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All samples were tested in duplicate to check for run variability resulting in a mean methylation score for each CpG site as well as an individual standard deviation (SD) for each duplicate. For quality control, SD > 0.1 of each duplicate was used as exclusion criterion. Additionally, outliers (\u2265 3*SD from mean methylation of respective CpG site) were defined as second exclusion criterion. In each sample,  N  = 6 participants had to be excluded from the reported analyses according to these criteria.\nThe obtained electropherograms were robustly readable for all five CpG sites, and CpG sites were numbered according to their GRCh37/hg19 Primary Assembly position: CpG1 = chr2:10,183,094; CpG2 = chr2:10,183,106; CpG3 = chr2:10,183,115; CpG4 = chr2:10,183,125; CpG5 = chr2:10,183,140 (all genomic locations according to GRCh37/hg19 Assembly, UCSC Genome Browser).\nStatistical analysis\nDifferences in dimensional sample characteristics were tested by means of independent samples  t  tests, and differences in categorical variables by means of Chi-square tests.  KLF11  methylation (average methylation, single CpG sites) between PD patients and controls (sample 1) and between MDD patients with anxious and non-anxious depression (sample 2), respectively, was compared by means of non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Correlations between  KLF11  methylation and BDI-II scores in sample 1 were evaluated by means of Spearman correlations ( \u03c1 ). Since no associations between average  KLF11  methylation and sex (sample 1:  t 112  = 1.056,  p  = 0.293; sample 2:  t 162  = - 0.137,  p  = 0.891), age (sample 1:  r  = 0.156;  p  = 0.097; sample 2:  r  = 0.054;  p  = 0.495), smoking status (sample 1:  t 112  = 0.745,  p  = 0.458; sample 2:  t 161  = 1.213;  p  = 0.227), or medication intake (sample 1:  t 57  = 1.384,  p  = 0.172; sample 2:  t 162  = - 0.123,  p  = 0.902) were found in either sample, analyses were not controlled for these variables. The significance level was set at  p  \u2264 0.05. Given the present proof-of-concept approach and high correlation between single CpG sites (data not shown), no correction for multiple testing was applied when analyzing single CpG sites and average  KLF11  methylation (cf.

{"doc_key": "7578153_Introduction", "text": ["\nPanic disorder (PD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders, with lifetime prevalence rates of 2.1-4.7% (Baxter et al.  2014 ) and a 12-month prevalence of 1.8% (Goodwin et al.  2005 ). PD is characterized by sudden, unexpected and recurrent panic attacks, i.e., episodes of extreme fear (American Psychiatric Association  2013 ). PD is often comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD; Gorman and Coplan  1996 ): Lifetime prevalence rates of comorbid MDD in PD are estimated at about 30-40% (Fava et al.  2000 ; Lamers et al.  2011 ; Kessler et al.  2015 ), similar to the lifetime prevalence rates of comorbid MDD in the group of anxiety disorders as a whole (Kessler et al.  2006 ).\nThe monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-metabolizing catecholamines such as norepinephrine and serotonin and being a target of potent antidepressants such as tranylcypromine-has been suggested as a key player in the pathogenesis of anxiety and mood disorders (for review see Ziegler and Domschke  2018 ). On an epigenetic level,  MAOA  hypomethylation has been reported in patients with PD (Domschke et al.  2012 ; Ziegler et al.  2016 ), acrophobia (Schiele et al.  2018 ), and MDD (Melas et al.  2013 ; Melas and Forsell  2015 ). Moreover,  MAOA  hypomethylation has been observed to be predictive of response to pharmacological treatment in MDD (Domschke et al.  2012 ) and to be modifiable by psychotherapeutic interventions in anxiety disorders (Ziegler et al.  2016 ; Schiele and Domschke  2018 ; Schiele et al.  2018 ; for review see Schiele et al.  2020 ).\nRecent studies have highlighted the Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 11 (KLF11; alias TGFB-Inducible Early Growth Response Protein 2 [TIEG2]) as a novel transcriptional activator of  MAOA  gene expression (for review see Duncan et al.  2012 ). KLF11 is a member of the Sp/KLF family of zinc finger transcription factors and regulates the transcription of neuronal genes by binding to distinct sequences within the target gene promoter region, triggering RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcriptional initiation (Ou et al.  2004 ; Harris et al.  2015 ). The  MAOA  promoter contains four Sp1-binding sites which have been reported to be a target of KLF11.

PD is characterized by sudden, unexpected and recurrent panic attacks, i.e., episodes of extreme fear (American Psychiatric Association  2013 ). PD is often comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD; Gorman and Coplan  1996 ): Lifetime prevalence rates of comorbid MDD in PD are estimated at about 30-40% (Fava et al.  2000 ; Lamers et al.  2011 ; Kessler et al.  2015 ), similar to the lifetime prevalence rates of comorbid MDD in the group of anxiety disorders as a whole (Kessler et al.  2006 ).\nThe monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-metabolizing catecholamines such as norepinephrine and serotonin and being a target of potent antidepressants such as tranylcypromine-has been suggested as a key player in the pathogenesis of anxiety and mood disorders (for review see Ziegler and Domschke  2018 ). On an epigenetic level,  MAOA  hypomethylation has been reported in patients with PD (Domschke et al.  2012 ; Ziegler et al.  2016 ), acrophobia (Schiele et al.  2018 ), and MDD (Melas et al.  2013 ; Melas and Forsell  2015 ). Moreover,  MAOA  hypomethylation has been observed to be predictive of response to pharmacological treatment in MDD (Domschke et al.  2012 ) and to be modifiable by psychotherapeutic interventions in anxiety disorders (Ziegler et al.  2016 ; Schiele and Domschke  2018 ; Schiele et al.  2018 ; for review see Schiele et al.  2020 ).\nRecent studies have highlighted the Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 11 (KLF11; alias TGFB-Inducible Early Growth Response Protein 2 [TIEG2]) as a novel transcriptional activator of  MAOA  gene expression (for review see Duncan et al.  2012 ). KLF11 is a member of the Sp/KLF family of zinc finger transcription factors and regulates the transcription of neuronal genes by binding to distinct sequences within the target gene promoter region, triggering RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcriptional initiation (Ou et al.  2004 ; Harris et al.  2015 ). The  MAOA  promoter contains four Sp1-binding sites which have been reported to be a target of KLF11. Accordingly, KLF11 transfection has been observed to result in a twofold increase in  MAOA  mRNA expression (Grunewald et al.  2012 ). Further support for a KLF11-MAOA pathway emerges from a study showing elevated KLF11 protein levels correlating with increased MAOA levels in postmortem brain samples of MDD patients (Harris et al.  2015 ).\nGiven these close links between KLF11 and MAOA function, the  KLF11  ( TIEG2 ) gene on chromosome 2p25.1 might constitute a prime, yet uninvestigated candidate gene in the panic disorder/MDD spectrum.

{"doc_key": "7578153_Discussion", "text": ["\nIn the present study, patients with PD and comorbid MDD displayed hypomethylation of the  KLF11  ( TIEG2 ) promoter region in comparison to a matched healthy control group as well as to PD patients without comorbid MDD. Correspondingly, a negative correlation of  KLF11  DNA methylation with dimensional symptoms of depression (as evaluated via the BDI-II) was observed in the PD patient group. Furthermore, in an independent sample of MDD patients, MDD patients without anxious features showed nominally significantly decreased  KLF11  methylation levels as compared to MDD patients with anxious depression.\nThe present results for the first time demonstrating  KLF11  promoter hypomethylation-presumably leading to increased  KLF11  gene expression (cf. Suzuki and Bird  2008 ) and, consequently, an overexpression of the  MAOA  gene (Grunewald et al.  2012 )-in depression-related phenotypes are in line with a previous finding of increased KLF11 and MAOA levels in MDD patients compared to healthy controls (Harris et al.  2015 ) and with studies reporting  MAOA  hypomethylation in female patients with MDD (Melas et al.  2013 ; Melas and Forsell  2015 ). The present findings, however, do not support a role of  KLF11  methylation in PD. Thus, against the theoretical background of a common biological trunk shared by anxiety and mood disorders,  KLF11  methylation could be instrumental in guiding the differentiation of the clinical phenotype toward depression- rather than panic-related symptoms.\nInterestingly, the results of this study mirror a recently published finding of serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) promoter hypermethylation in PD patients with comorbid MDD relative to healthy controls, but not in PD per se (Schiele et al.  2019 ). Consequently, future studies might want to explore the biochemical relationship between KLF11 and SLC6A4 function in the context of MDD, especially given that the  SLC6A4  promotor region has been shown to contain Sp1 binding sites (Bengel et al.  1997 ; Heils et al.  1998 ), which might be targeted by KLF11 (cf. Grunewald et al.  2012 ).\nThe present findings should be interpreted in light of some limitations and might inspire future research efforts. For example, replication in independent, larger samples is warranted due to the relatively small group sizes of PD patients with and without comorbid depression, or MDD patients with and without anxious features, respectively, to confirm  KLF11  hypomethylation as a potential selective differential diagnostic marker of MDD comorbidity in PD or non-anxious MDD. Given that MDD is highly comorbid not only with PD but also with other anxiety and mental disorders, the potential of  KLF11  methylation status as a diagnostic marker to separate MDD diagnosis from other diagnoses should be explored in future studies. This would require a direct comparison with other comorbidity profiles, as well as comorbidity of MDD within other anxiety or mental disorders and a direct comparison of a PD sample with an MDD sample (i.e., PD with MDD vs. MDD only, PD without MDD vs. MDD only). Additionally, since no control group was available for the MDD sample (sample 2), the observed differences of  KLF11  methylation in MDD patients with or without anxious depression cannot be clearly ascribed to the effects of anxious symptoms. Moreover, longitudinal studies would help to elucidate whether the observed  KLF11  hypomethylation constitutes a trait or state marker of MDD. Despite the fact that in the present study PD patients and controls were matched for sex, age and smoking status, additional potentially confounding factors such as environmental exposure (cf. Domschke et al.  2012 ) cannot be excluded. Therefore, investigation of the impact of life events on  KLF11  methylation levels applying an (epi)gene-environment approach would pose a promising future research direction, particularly given previous evidence for a strong influence of stress on KLF11 expression (Grunewald et al.  2012 ; Harris et al.  2015 ). In addition, although no statistically significant influence of medication status on  KLF11  methylation was observed in either sample, potentially confounding effects of psychiatric medication on  KLF11  methylation cannot be fully excluded given that 57% (sample 1) or 79% (sample 2), respectively, of patients were on stable medication at the time of testing. Also, next to the differential effects of  KLF11  methylation on categorical disorder phenotypes, future studies may want to probe the association of  KLF11  methylation with symptom subtypes/subgroups as well as with disorder-specific intermediate phenotypes, and differential DNA methylation markers of panic disorder and MDD should be explored on an epigenome-wide level by means of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) (cf. Shimada-Sugimoto et al.  2017 ; Iurato et al.  2017 ; Shimada et al.  2018 ; Ziegler et al.  2019 ). Although pyrosequencing is currently considered the gold standard of DNA methylation analysis with a sensitivity to reliably detect differences as small as 5% (e.g., Dejeux et al.  2009 ; Migheli et al.  2013 ; Poulin et al.  2018 ), low methylation percentages (< 10%) may be confounded by unsystematic noise. In the present study, CpGs 2 and 3 achieved average methylation levels > 10% or > 20%, respectively, and might therefore constitute regions of particular interest for further analyses. For instance, analysis of a restricted target region of CpGs 2 and 3 utilizing the transcription factor-binding site prediction tool PROMO (Messeguer et al.  2002 ) identified the binding site of transcription factor TFI-II, a ubiquitously expressed protein, involved in growth factor signaling (Roy et al.  2007 ), to be located at CpG3, thus constituting a putative transcription factor whose binding affinity at this region could be affected by DNA methylation. Thus, future functional approaches may want to experimentally confirm a differential influence of  KLF11  methylation on TFI-II binding. Finally, DNA methylation was measured in peripheral blood samples. Given that epigenetic processes can act in a cell type-specific way, a cofounding effect due to potential variation in white blood cell composition between patients and controls cannot be excluded. Furthermore, epigenetic analyses in peripheral biomaterial such as blood does not allow for direct conclusions regarding methylation levels in brain tissue. Nevertheless, animal studies intraindividually comparing peripheral and central methylation or studies comparing peripheral methylation with central activity of the respective metabolite in humans using positron emission tomography (PET) have provided some evidence for DNA methylation levels measured in blood as a proxy for central processes (e.g., Murphy et al.  2005 ; Nohesara et al.  2011 ; Shumay et al.  2012 ). Also, when performing an  in silico  analysis of the correlation between blood and brain DNA methylation levels at the investigated  KLF11  region using the online available \"Blood Brain DNA Methylation Comparison Tool\" (Hannon et al.  2015 ), peripheral DNA methylation of both CpG1 (cg22541755) and CpG3 (cg20702913) was positively correlated with prefrontal cortex methylation ( r  \u2265 0.332,  p  \u2264 0.004). Analysis of further  KLF11  CpGs was precluded by the fact that only CpGs 1 and 3 are available in this search tool based on Illumina 450 K array data.\nIn conclusion, the present pilot data suggest  KLF11  promoter hypomethylation as a potential epigenetic marker of MDD comorbidity in PD or non-anxious depression, respectively, possibly contributing to a differential pathomechanism of anxiety and mood disorders. In synopsis with previous findings implicating KLF11 in depression-related phenotypes (Harris et al.  2015 ), this finding is of mechanistic relevance and might foster research efforts into exploring innovative therapeutic approaches targeting this pathway in the treatment of major depression.\n"], "ner": [[[37, 39, "DISEASE"], [53, 56, "DISEASE"], [91, 96, "GENE"], [100, 105, "GENE"], [187, 189, "DISEASE"], [216, 219, "DISEASE"], [265, 270, "GENE"], [378, 380, "DISEASE"], [437, 440, "DISEASE"], [451, 454, "DISEASE"], [531, 536, "GENE"], [572, 575, "DISEASE"], [664, 669, "GENE"], [729, 734, "GENE"], [826, 830, "GENE"], [[935, 960], [944, 966], "RELATION"], [945, 950, "GENE"], [955, 959, "GENE"], [970, 973, "DISEASE"], [1063, 1067, "GENE"], [1109, 1112, "DISEASE"], [1219, 1224, "GENE"], [1241, 1243, "DISEASE"], [1354, 1359, "GENE"], [1587, 1613, "GENE"], [1616, 1622, "GENE"], [1654, 1656, "DISEASE"], [1680, 1683, "DISEASE"], [1725, 1727, "DISEASE"], [1848, 1853, "GENE"], [1858, 1864, "GENE"], [1892, 1895, "GENE"], [1924, 1930, "GENE"], [1974, 1977, "GENE"], [2064, 2069, "GENE"], [2328, 2330, "DISEASE"], [2381, 2384, "DISEASE"], [2455, 2460, "GENE"], [2537, 2540, "DISEASE"], [2556, 2558, "DISEASE"], [2574, 2577, "DISEASE"], [2590, 2593, "DISEASE"], [2627, 2629, "DISEASE"], [2698, 2703, "GENE"], [2759, 2762, "DISEASE"], [2930, 2933, "DISEASE"], [3004, 3006, "DISEASE"], [3022, 3025, "DISEASE"], [3040, 3042, "DISEASE"], [3048, 3051, "DISEASE"], [3056, 3059, "DISEASE"], [3066, 3068, "DISEASE"], [3077, 3080, "DISEASE"], [3085, 3088, "DISEASE"], [3155, 3158, "DISEASE"], [3207, 3212, "GENE"], [3229, 3232, "DISEASE"], [3417, 3422, "GENE"], [3479, 3482, "DISEASE"], [3527, 3529, "DISEASE"], [3779, 3784, "GENE"], [3971, 3976, "GENE"]], [[4123, 4128, "GENE"], [4235, 4240, "GENE"], [4443, 4448, "GENE"], [4551, 4556, "GENE"], [4705, 4719, "DISEASE"], [4724, 4727, "DISEASE"], [5994, 5999, "GENE"], [7007, 7012, "GENE"], [7303, 7308, "GENE"], [7481, 7486, "GENE"], [7528, 7545, "RELATION"], [7549, 7552, "DISEASE"], [7568, 7570, "DISEASE"], [7745, 7750, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[945, 950, 970, 973, "increased expression"], [955, 959, 970, 973, "increased expression"]], [[7481, 7486, 7549, 7552, "epigenetic marker"], [7481, 7486, 7568, 7570, "epigenetic marker"]]], "triplets": [[[945, 950, 970, 973, [935, 960], [944, 966]], [955, 959, 970, 973, [935, 960], [944, 966]]], [[7481, 7486, 7549, 7552, 7528, 7545], [7481, 7486, 7568, 7570, 7528, 7545]]], "triplets_text": [[["KLF11", "MDD", "increased levels"], ["MAOA", "MDD", "increased levels"]], [["KLF11", "MDD", "epigenetic marker"], ["KLF11", "PD", "epigenetic marker"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nIn the present study, patients with PD and comorbid MDD displayed hypomethylation of the  KLF11  ( TIEG2 ) promoter region in comparison to a matched healthy control group as well as to PD patients without comorbid MDD.

Altered methylation of the monoamine oxidase A ( MAOA ) gene has been implicated in the etiology of both PD and MDD. The Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 11 (KLF11; alias TIEG2), an activating transcription factor of the  MAOA  gene, has been found to be increased in MDD, but has not yet been investigated in PD. In an effort to further delineate the effects of the KLF11-MAOA pathway in anxiety and affective disorders,  KLF11  promoter methylation was analyzed via pyrosequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from human peripheral blood in two independent samples of PD patients with or without comorbid MDD in a case-control design (sample 1:  N  = 120) as well as MDD patients with and without anxious depression (sample 2:  N  = 170). Additionally, in sample 1,  KLF11  methylation was correlated with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores. No overall association of  KLF11  promoter methylation with PD was detected. However, PD patients with comorbid MDD showed significant hypomethylation relative to both healthy controls ( p  = 0.010) and PD patients without comorbid MDD ( p  = 0.008).

Altered methylation of the monoamine oxidase A ( MAOA ) gene has been implicated in the etiology of both PD and MDD. The Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 11 (KLF11; alias TIEG2), an activating transcription factor of the  MAOA  gene, has been found to be increased in MDD, but has not yet been investigated in PD. In an effort to further delineate the effects of the KLF11-MAOA pathway in anxiety and affective disorders,  KLF11  promoter methylation was analyzed via pyrosequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from human peripheral blood in two independent samples of PD patients with or without comorbid MDD in a case-control design (sample 1:  N  = 120) as well as MDD patients with and without anxious depression (sample 2:  N  = 170). Additionally, in sample 1,  KLF11  methylation was correlated with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores. No overall association of  KLF11  promoter methylation with PD was detected. However, PD patients with comorbid MDD showed significant hypomethylation relative to both healthy controls ( p  = 0.010) and PD patients without comorbid MDD ( p  = 0.008). Furthermore,  KLF11  methylation was negatively correlated with BDI-II scores in PD patients ( p  = 0.013). MDD patients without anxious features showed nominally decreased  KLF11  methylation in comparison to MDD patients with anxious depression ( p  = 0.052). The present results suggest  KLF11  promoter hypomethylation as a potential epigenetic marker of MDD comorbidity in PD or of non-anxious depression, respectively, possibly constituting a differential pathomechanism in anxiety and mood disorders.\n"]}

Animals were allowed food and water  ad libitum . All animal experiments were conducted under strict governmental and international guidelines and were approved by the local government for the administrative region of Upper Bavaria, Germany.\nInduction and measurement of murine pulmonary fibrosis\nPulmonary fibrosis was induced in female C57BL/6 mice (10-12 weeks old) by a single intratracheal instillation of 50 \u03bcl of bleomycin (3 U/kg, Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) dissolved in sterile saline, and applied using the MicroSprayer Aerosolizer, Model IA-1 C (Penn-Century, Wyndmoor, PA). Control mice were instilled with 50 \u03bcl of saline. After instillation, mice were kept for 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. Before sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine followed by lung function measurement and tissue harvesting as previously described 35 62 . Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained as previously described 35 . Fibrosis was further assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts and histology evaluation.\nProteomic data\nTime- and compartment-resolved protein profiles from BALF and lung tissue during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis were extracted from proteomics data generated previously by us 35 . These data are publicly available in the  supplementary material  of the corresponding open access article 35  or via the MaxQB database ( http://maxqb.biochem.mpg.de/mxdb/  project/show/P013) 63 . Data are always reported as log2 fold changes relative to the median of all control mice from the study (n = 28), if not mentioned otherwise.\nPatients\nPatients diagnosed with IPF (n = 7), SRIF (n = 3), HP (n = 15), and sarcoidosis (n = 5) were included in the study after signing an informed consent agreement. Patient demographics und lung function data are provided in  Table 1 . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Thomayer Hospital and the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines. All enrolled patients provided a medical history that included information on smoking and potential exposure to inhaled antigens and underwent a medical examination that involved: a chest X-ray, HRCT of the chest, pulmonary function tests, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). IPF was diagnosed according to the ERS/ATS guidelines 64 . SRIF was diagnosed according to typical radiologic and histopathological findings in combination with a history of smoking, as published by Katzenstein  et al . 3 . Diagnosis of HP was performed as reported previously 65 . Finally, sarcoidosis was diagnosed using the ATS/ERS/WASOG criteria 66 . Notably, this patient cohort included HP and sarcoidosis patients at different disease stages including such with resolving disease.\nFor immunofluorescence stainings and Western Blot analysis, resected human lung tissue and lung explant material was obtained from the BioArchive CPC-M for lung diseases at the Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC). Here, all HP and IPF samples were lung explant material from transplantations, reflecting non-resolving end-stage disease. All participants gave written informed consent and this part of the study was approved by the local ethics committee of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany (333-10) and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.\nPulmonary function tests\nForced vital capacity (FVC) was obtained using a ZAN 100 Flowhandy II (Inspire, Oberthulba, Germany). Values are shown as percentage of the predicted value.\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)\nBAL was performed during fiberoptic bronchoscopy under local anaesthesia. The bronchoscope was wedged into a segmental bronchus of the middle lobe. Five fractions of 50 ml of lukewarm saline were instilled and, after each instillation, gently aspirated. Only samples with a recovery > 50% were used (mean recovery per one fraction was 57 \u00b1 20%). The retrieved fluid was placed in a sterile container before division for further investigation. Five millilitres of BALF was aliquoted and stored at -80 \u00b0C.\nHuman lung material and isolation and culture of primary human lung fibroblasts\nFor isolation of primary human lung fibroblasts (phLF), for Western Blot, and for immunofluorescent stainings, resected human lung tissue and lung explant material was obtained from the BioArchive CPC-M for lung diseases at the Comprehensive Pneumology Center (CPC). HP and IPF patient material was exclusively derived from lung explant material, representing end-stage disease. Primary human lung fibroblasts for  in vitro  experiments were isolated from histologically normal regions adjacent to resected lung tumours. All participants gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany (333-10).\nIsolation of phLF from lung tissue was performed as described in detail elsewhere 46 : Briefly, human lung specimens were dissected and digested using 1 mg/ml Collagenase I (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour. Samples were then passed through nylon filters with a pore size of 70 \u03bcm (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), followed by centrifugation at 400 \u00d7  g  and 4 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) and plated on 10 cm cell-culture dishes. Medium was changed after 2 days and cells were split after reaching a confluence of 80-90%. For the present study, phLF from four different donors were used in passages 6-8. Fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% FBS (Pan Biotech) and penicillin/streptomycin.\nCulture and differentiation of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (phBEC)\nNormal primary human bronchial epithelial cells (phBEC) from three healthy donors were obtained from Lonza (Wokingham, UK), cultured in BEGM medium (Lonza) and differentiated at the air-liquid interface (ALI) in PneumaCult\u2122-ALI medium (Stemcell Technologies, Cologne, Germany) for up to 28-33 days as described previously 67 . Briefly, 80.000-90.000 cells (passage 2) were seeded on human placental collagen type IV-coated (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) 12-well transwell inserts (clear, 0.4 \u03bcm; Corning; New York, NY, USA) in BEGM medium. Cells were air-lifted upon confluency (=day 0 of ALI culture) by removing the apical medium and substituting the basolateral medium with PneumaCult\u2122-ALI medium containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Medium was changed every other day and cells were washed apically with HBSS (Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA) once a week to remove mucus.\nTreatment of phLF and phBEC with TGF-beta1, TNF-\u03b1, and menadione\nFor treatment of phLF, cells were seeded at a density of approximately 20,000 cells/cm 2 , starved for 24 hours in DMEM/F12 with 0.5% FBS and 100 nM sodium selenite, followed by treatment with 2 ng/ml TGF-beta1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MM, USA), 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), and 10 \u03bcM menadione (Sigma-Aldrich) in starvation medium for the indicated time points.\nFor treatment of phBEC, fully differentiated cells were stimulated for 24 or 48 hours with 2 ng/ml TGF-beta1, 10 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1, 10 \u03bcM menadione from the apical (in 100 \u03bcl HBSS) and basolateral side (in 1 ml ALI medium) simultaneously. Menadione was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); here, control cells were treated using the same volume of DMSO.\nRNA isolation and real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis\nFor RNA extraction, the peqGold RNA isolation kit (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) was used for phLF and the RNeasy Mini Plus Kit (Quiagen; Venlo, Holland) was used for phBEC according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 40 \u03bcl reaction using M-MLV reverse transcriptase and random hexamers, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany).\nRelative transcript abundance of a gene is expressed as -DeltaC t  values (-DeltaC t  = C t reference  - C t target ) or as fold change derived from the relevant DeltaDeltaC t  values, using 2 -(DeltaDeltaCt) . For specific gene amplification, primers listed in  Table 2  were used. ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX8 (DHX8) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were used as endogenous controls for standardization of relative mRNA expression in phLF and phBEC, respectively. Normalization with both reference genes provided similar results and, for data presentation, analysis was performed using DHX8 as reference gene. In a previous study 45  we have assessed the quality of a number of reference genes for lung transcriptomes derived from Genevestigator V3 68  and found that DHX8 was a reliable reference gene in this context.\nWestern Blot analysis for detection of GPX3 in whole lung lysates\nWestern Blot analysis was performed as described previously 46 . For detection of human GPX3, mouse monoclonal anti-GPX3 antibody (abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab27325) and for detection of beta-actin, an HRP-conjugated anti-beta-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, Louis, MO, USA; A3854) was used.\nELISA for detection of GPX3 in BALF, cell culture supernatant, and tissue homogenates\nFor detection of human GPX3 in human BALF, cell culture supernatants and tissue homogenates, the GPX3 human ELISA Kit (AdipoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. For phBEC, only the basolateral supernatant was analysed, as no GPX3 was detected in the apical supernatant. For BALF and cell culture supernatants, 100 \u03bcl sample were used and the results expressed as a concentration in ng/ml. For tissue homogenates, 5 \u03bcg total protein were used and the results normalized to amount of total input protein and expressed as ng GPX3/\u03bcg protein.\nMeasurement of glutathione peroxidase activity in mouse BALF\nSelenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity in mouse BALF was measured by monitoring fluorescence at 460 nm with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm in a Berthold plate reader (Tristar LB941, Bad Wildbad, Germany) 69 . Reactions were performed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1% Triton-X-100, 0.40 mM EDTA, 0.20 mM NADPH, 0.25 U glutathione reductase from Baker's yeast, 1 mM L-glutathione, and 100 \u03bcM  t -butyl hydroperoxide (all Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl. Reactions were started by adding 50 \u03bcl mouse BALF. 50 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline was used as negative and 0.01 U bovine GPX (Sigma Aldrich) as positive control, respectively. Data are reported as activity fold changes relative to the median of control activity for each time point (n = 29).\nImmunofluorescent stainings\nFor staining of tissue sections, human and murine lung tissue was fixed in 4% formalin prior to paraffin embedding. Three-micron sections were prepared and mounted on slides, followed by deparaffinization and immunofluorescent staining according to a standard protocol as follows: For deparaffinization, the paraffin-embedded sections were placed at 60 \u00b0C for at least 30 min, incubated twice in xylene (5 minutes each), and then transferred into 100% ethanol (2 minutes), 100% ethanol (2 minutes), 90% ethanol (1 minute), 80% ethanol (1 minute), and 70% ethanol (1 minute) at room temperature. Sections were rinsed in deionized water and stored in 0.5 M Tris, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 6.8 (termed Tris buffer hereafter). For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed in citrate buffer pH 6.0 and heated in a Decloaking Chamber 30 seconds at 125 \u00b0C, followed by 10 seconds at 90 \u00b0C. Then, the slides were allowed to slowly cool down to room temperature. Slides were washed three times in Tris buffer and primary antibody dilutions were prepared in antibody diluent (Zytomed Systems, Berlin, Germany), added to each tissue section in a wet chamber and incubated overnight. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-Gpx3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:50 or 1:100) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Collagen I antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA, 1:200). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG from Life Technologies (both 1:400). Slides were rinsed three times with Tris buffer and counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2500) for 1 minute in darkness. Then slides were rinsed three times with Tris buffer, covered with Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and examined under an Axio Imager Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).\n"], "ner": [[[469, 487, "DISEASE"], [488, 506, "DISEASE"], [1345, 1358, "DISEASE"], [1800, 1803, "DISEASE"], [1844, 1855, "DISEASE"], [2507, 2510, "DISEASE"], [2798, 2809, "DISEASE"], [2907, 2918, "DISEASE"], [3228, 3231, "DISEASE"]], [[7233, 7242, "GENE"], [7289, 7294, "GENE"]], [[8671, 8675, "GENE"], [8677, 8681, "GENE"], [9250, 9254, "GENE"], [9393, 9397, "GENE"], [9460, 9470, "GENE"], [9587, 9591, "GENE"], [9673, 9677, "GENE"], [9747, 9751, "GENE"], [9914, 9918, "GENE"], [10211, 10215, "GENE"]], [[12323, 12327, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3], "sentences": ["\nAnimals\nPathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice (10-12 weeks old) were obtained from Charles River and housed in rooms maintained at constant temperature and humidity with a 12 hours light cycle.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany).\nRelative transcript abundance of a gene is expressed as -DeltaC t  values (-DeltaC t  = C t reference  - C t target ) or as fold change derived from the relevant DeltaDeltaC t  values, using 2 -(DeltaDeltaCt) . For specific gene amplification, primers listed in  Table 2  were used. ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX8 (DHX8) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were used as endogenous controls for standardization of relative mRNA expression in phLF and phBEC, respectively. Normalization with both reference genes provided similar results and, for data presentation, analysis was performed using DHX8 as reference gene. In a previous study 45  we have assessed the quality of a number of reference genes for lung transcriptomes derived from Genevestigator V3 68  and found that DHX8 was a reliable reference gene in this context.\nWestern Blot analysis for detection of GPX3 in whole lung lysates\nWestern Blot analysis was performed as described previously 46 . For detection of human GPX3, mouse monoclonal anti-GPX3 antibody (abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab27325) and for detection of beta-actin, an HRP-conjugated anti-beta-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, Louis, MO, USA; A3854) was used.\nELISA for detection of GPX3 in BALF, cell culture supernatant, and tissue homogenates\nFor detection of human GPX3 in human BALF, cell culture supernatants and tissue homogenates, the GPX3 human ELISA Kit (AdipoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. For phBEC, only the basolateral supernatant was analysed, as no GPX3 was detected in the apical supernatant. For BALF and cell culture supernatants, 100 \u03bcl sample were used and the results expressed as a concentration in ng/ml. For tissue homogenates, 5 \u03bcg total protein were used and the results normalized to amount of total input protein and expressed as ng GPX3/\u03bcg protein.\nMeasurement of glutathione peroxidase activity in mouse BALF\nSelenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity in mouse BALF was measured by monitoring fluorescence at 460 nm with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm in a Berthold plate reader (Tristar LB941, Bad Wildbad, Germany) 69 . Reactions were performed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 0.1% Triton-X-100, 0.40 mM EDTA, 0.20 mM NADPH, 0.25 U glutathione reductase from Baker's yeast, 1 mM L-glutathione, and 100 \u03bcM  t -butyl hydroperoxide (all Sigma-Aldrich) in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl. Reactions were started by adding 50 \u03bcl mouse BALF. 50 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline was used as negative and 0.01 U bovine GPX (Sigma Aldrich) as positive control, respectively. Data are reported as activity fold changes relative to the median of control activity for each time point (n = 29).\nImmunofluorescent stainings\nFor staining of tissue sections, human and murine lung tissue was fixed in 4% formalin prior to paraffin embedding. Three-micron sections were prepared and mounted on slides, followed by deparaffinization and immunofluorescent staining according to a standard protocol as follows: For deparaffinization, the paraffin-embedded sections were placed at 60 \u00b0C for at least 30 min, incubated twice in xylene (5 minutes each), and then transferred into 100% ethanol (2 minutes), 100% ethanol (2 minutes), 90% ethanol (1 minute), 80% ethanol (1 minute), and 70% ethanol (1 minute) at room temperature. Sections were rinsed in deionized water and stored in 0.", "5 M Tris, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 6.8 (termed Tris buffer hereafter). For antigen retrieval, slides were immersed in citrate buffer pH 6.0 and heated in a Decloaking Chamber 30 seconds at 125 \u00b0C, followed by 10 seconds at 90 \u00b0C. Then, the slides were allowed to slowly cool down to room temperature. Slides were washed three times in Tris buffer and primary antibody dilutions were prepared in antibody diluent (Zytomed Systems, Berlin, Germany), added to each tissue section in a wet chamber and incubated overnight. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-Gpx3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:50 or 1:100) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Collagen I antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA, 1:200). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG from Life Technologies (both 1:400). Slides were rinsed three times with Tris buffer and counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2500) for 1 minute in darkness. Then slides were rinsed three times with Tris buffer, covered with Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and examined under an Axio Imager Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).\n"]}
{"doc_key": "4951690_Results Rev", "text": ["\nGpx3 is upregulated in BALF and tissue in the mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis\nInitially, in order to assess expression and regulation of lung-abundant extracellular antioxidant proteins, we extracted the relevant data from a previously published proteomic study on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 35 . Lung-abundant antioxidant proteins with known extracellular location include Gpx1 36 , Gpx3 32 33 , Sod3 37 , peroxiredoxin IV (Prdx4) 31 , and peroxiredoxin VI (Prdx6) 38 . All of these, except for Prdx6, were highly abundant in BALF of control mice under basal conditions ( Fig. 1A , left-hand panel) and Gpx3 and Sod3 were additionally upregulated in BALF during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis ( Fig. 1B ). As protein abundance of Gpx3 in BALF under normal conditions was substantially higher than for Gpx1 ( Fig. 1A , left-hand panel, appr. 5 times higher), we reasoned that selenium-dependent Gpx activity in BALF should reflect GPX3 activity. In agreement, selenium-dependent Gpx activity was significantly increased 7 and 14 days after bleomycin instillation and returned to baseline thereafter ( Fig. 1C ). Finally, both BALF Gpx3 levels as well as Gpx activity in BALF showed anti-correlation with lung function (Spearman r = -0.4135, p = 0.0699 for Gpx3 protein; Spearman r = -0.7152, p = 0.0006 for Gpx activity;  Fig. 1D ).\nIn lung tissue, all antioxidant proteins assessed belonged to the quartile of proteins with the highest abundance and, here, contrary to BALF, Prdx6 displayed the highest levels ( Fig. 1A , right-hand panel). In response to bleomycin, Gpx3 was upregulated also in tissue, albeit to a lesser extent compared to the increase in BALF, while Sod3 was largely unchanged, except during initial acute lung injury ( Fig. 1E ). Furthermore, in contrast to Sod3, tissue Gpx3 was predominantly detected in the insoluble protein fractions, as judged from quantitative detergent solubility profiling (QDSP) generated by Schiller  et al . 35  ( Fig. 1F ). Notably, these insoluble fractions are highly enriched for ECM and matrisome-associated proteins 35 39 .\nIn mouse lung, Gpx3 is expressed by bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts and localizes to the ECM\nImmunofluorescent stainings showed that, in normal mouse lungs, Gpx3 was mostly secreted by bronchial epithelial cells, where clear vesicular staining was observed ( Fig. 2A , left-hand panels). In addition, we detected localization to the subendothelial and subepithelial basement membrane ( Fig. 2A , left-hand panel, higher magnification insert). Upon development of lung fibrosis following tracheal instillation of bleomycin, Gpx3 expression was observed in many more cells including bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts ( Fig. 2A,B , right-hand panels). Localization to the subendothelial and subepithelial basement membrane was conserved in fibrotic mouse lungs and, additionally, we observed localization to the interstitial ECM as demonstrated by colocalization with extracellular collagen I ( Fig. 2B , right-hand panel, higher magnification insert). Localization of Gpx3 to the interstitial ECM was also evident in more distal areas of fibrotic mouse lung, even if less prominent ( Supplemental Figure S1 ).\nHigh GPX3 levels are found in BALF of some HP and sarcoidosis, but not of IPF and SRIF patients\nELISA-based analysis of GPX3 levels in BALF from ILD patients showed consistently low GPX3 levels in patients with IPF and SRIF, but high levels for some HP and sarcoidosis patients ( Fig. 3A ). In contrast to the animal lung function data ( cf .  Fig. 1D ), there was no correlation of BALF GPX3 levels with forced vital capacity (FVC) ( Fig. 3B ). As gender-specific differences in serum GPX3 and selenoprotein status have been observed 40 41 , we examined the relationship between gender and GPX3 levels in all BALF samples, but found no significant influence of gender on GPX3 levels in this cohort ( Fig. 3C ). Given that GPX3 is a selenoprotein and selenium deficiency has been associated with aging and increased mortality among the elderly 42 43 44 , we also examined a possible correlation between age and GPX3 levels and found that there was no significant correlation ( Fig. 3D ). Finally, smoking status also did not have a significant effect, although, interestingly, GPX3 tended to be decreased in BALF of patients with smoking history ( Fig. 3E ).\nGPX3 is upregulated in total tissue lysates from IPF patients\nWestern Blot analysis and ELISA, using independently derived antibodies, showed upregulation of GPX3 protein levels in total lung lysates from IPF patients, but not from end-stage HP patients, relative to healthy donor control ( Fig. 4 ,  Supplementary Figure S2 ).\nIn lung tissue sections of HP and IPF patients, GPX3 localizes to ECM structures\nImmunofluorescence analysis of human tissue sections supported the colocalization of GPX3 with the bronchial basement membrane in donor, HP and IPF patients, as demonstrated by costaining with extracellular collagen type I ( Fig. 5A , indicated with arrows in the higher magnification inserts). Bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial cells, next to not further characterized immune cells, seem to be major producers of GPX3 in the human lung. Additionally, in contrast to donor tissue, GPX3 clearly also localized to the interstitial matrix in HP and IPF patients ( Fig. 5B , indicated with arrows in the higher magnification inserts).\nGPX3 is expressed by primary human bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts and is variably regulated by TGF-beta1, TNF-\u03b1, and the oxidative stress inducer menadione\nNext, we assessed whether GPX3 was expressed in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (phBECs) and primary human lung fibroblasts (phLFs)  in vitro . For both cell types we observed similar expression of GPX3 on transcript level, comparable to expression of ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX8 (DHX8) used as endogenous control 45  ( Fig. 6 , left-hand panel). GPX3 was also detected in the cell culture supernatant of both cell types ( Fig. 6 , right-hand panel). Here, GPX3 levels were higher in the basolateral cell culture supernatant of phBECs than in cell culture supernatant of phLF.\nAs we had observed upregulation of GPX3 both during the inflammatory (day 7) and fibrotic (day 14) phase of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis 35 46  ( Fig. 1B,C,E ), upregulation in IPF ( Fig. 4 ), as well as high levels in BALF from ILDs with a strong inflammatory component such as HP and sarcoidosis ( cf .  Fig. 3A ), we investigated whether GPX3 is upregulated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 or the profibrotic cytokine TGF-beta1 in phBEC and phLF. We found consistent downregulation of GPX3 expression by TNF-\u03b1 in both cell types, both on transcript and on secreted protein level ( Figs 7A  and  8A ). For TGF-beta1, we found a weak upregulation in phBEC ( Fig. 7B ), but significant downregulation in phLF ( Fig. 8B ). In contrast, menadione, an inducer of oxidative stress, increased GPX3 expression in phLF, but not in phBEC ( Figs 7C  and  8C , respectively). Efficacy of TNF-\u03b1, TGF-beta1, and menadione treatment was verified using well-established target genes,  i.e.  interleukin-6 (IL6), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1), and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1), respectively.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 5, "GENE"], [9, 20, "RELATION"], [80, 98, "DISEASE"], [304, 322, "DISEASE"], [405, 409, "GENE"], [415, 419, "GENE"], [428, 432, "GENE"], [438, 454, "GENE"], [456, 461, "GENE"], [472, 488, "GENE"], [490, 495, "GENE"], [527, 532, "GENE"], [635, 639, "GENE"], [644, 648, "GENE"], [763, 767, "GENE"], [834, 838, "GENE"], [963, 967, "GENE"], [1163, 1167, "GENE"], [1508, 1513, "GENE"], [1600, 1604, "GENE"], [1703, 1707, "GENE"], [1812, 1816, "GENE"], [1825, 1829, "GENE"], [2127, 2131, "GENE"], [2285, 2289, "GENE"], [2651, 2655, "GENE"], [3116, 3120, "GENE"], [[3258, 3268], [3262, 3274], "RELATION"], [3263, 3267, "GENE"], [3308, 3319, "DISEASE"], [3332, 3335, "DISEASE"], [3378, 3382, "GENE"], [3403, 3406, "DISEASE"], [[3436, 3445], [3439, 3451], "RELATION"], [3440, 3444, "GENE"], [3469, 3472, "DISEASE"], [3487, 3498, "RELATION"], [3515, 3526, "DISEASE"], [3646, 3650, "GENE"], [3744, 3748, "GENE"], [3849, 3853, "GENE"], [3930, 3934, "GENE"], [3981, 3985, "GENE"]], [[4169, 4173, "GENE"], [4335, 4339, "GENE"], [4417, 4421, "GENE"], [4425, 4436, "RELATION"], [4466, 4469, "DISEASE"], [4559, 4571, "RELATION"], [4575, 4579, "GENE"], [4622, 4625, "DISEASE"], [4793, 4797, "GENE"], [4911, 4915, "GENE"], [4970, 4973, "DISEASE"], [5250, 5254, "GENE"], [5317, 5321, "GENE"], [5382, 5385, "GENE"], [5467, 5471, "GENE"], [5579, 5588, "GENE"], [5590, 5595, "GENE"], [5666, 5670, "GENE"], [5847, 5851, "GENE"], [5928, 5932, "GENE"], [5934, 5938, "GENE"], [6000, 6004, "GENE"], [6110, 6114, "GENE"], [6249, 6261, "RELATION"], [6265, 6269, "GENE"], [6356, 6369, "DISEASE"], [6394, 6406, "RELATION"], [6410, 6413, "DISEASE"], [6519, 6530, "DISEASE"], [6574, 6578, "GENE"], [6626, 6631, "GENE"], [6660, 6669, "GENE"], [6727, 6731, "GENE"], [6746, 6751, "GENE"], [6847, 6856, "GENE"], [7027, 7031, "GENE"], [7117, 7122, "GENE"], [7124, 7133, "GENE"], [7216, 7229, "GENE"], [7231, 7234, "GENE"], [7237, 7270, "GENE"], [7272, 7276, "GENE"], [7283, 7316, "GENE"], [7318, 7322, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[1, 5, 80, 98, "increased expression"], [3263, 3267, 3308, 3319, "increased expression"], [3440, 3444, 3469, 3472, "decreased expression"], [3440, 3444, 3515, 3526, "increased expression"]], [[4417, 4421, 4466, 4469, "increased expression"], [4575, 4579, 4622, 4625, "increased expression"], [6265, 6269, 6356, 6369, "increased expression"], [6265, 6269, 6410, 6413, "increased expression"]]], "triplets": [[[1, 5, 80, 98, 9, 20], [3263, 3267, 3308, 3319, [3258, 3268], [3262, 3274]], [3440, 3444, 3469, 3472, [3436, 3445], [3439, 3451]], [3440, 3444, 3515, 3526, 3487, 3498]], [[4417, 4421, 4466, 4469, 4425, 4436], [4575, 4579, 4622, 4625, 4559, 4571], [6265, 6269, 6356, 6369, 6249, 6261], [6265, 6269, 6410, 6413, 6394, 6406]]], "triplets_text": [[["Gpx3", "pulmonary fibrosis", "upregulated"], ["GPX3", "sarcoidosis", "High levels"], ["GPX3", "IPF", "low levels"], ["GPX3", "sarcoidosis", "high levels"]], [["GPX3", "IPF", "upregulated"], ["GPX3", "IPF", "upregulation"], ["GPX3", "lung fibrosis", "upregulation"], ["GPX3", "IPF", "upregulation"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nGpx3 is upregulated in BALF and tissue in the mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis\nInitially, in order to assess expression and regulation of lung-abundant extracellular antioxidant proteins, we extracted the relevant data from a previously published proteomic study on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 35 .

{"doc_key": "4951690_Discussion Rev", "text": ["\nMany ILDs are triggered by oxidative insults to the airways, but regulation of extracellular antioxidant proteins has gained little attention in this context. In the present study, we show that levels of the antioxidant protein GPX3 are increased in BALF and tissue during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, as well as in BALF of some HP and sarcoidosis patients and in total lung homogenates of IPF patients. GPX3 was expressed by bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts. While GPX3 localized mainly to the basement membrane of the bronchial epithelium and endothelium in healthy mouse and human tissue, we found localization also to the interstitial ECM in fibrotic tissue compartments. Finally, GPX3 expression in bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts was downregulated by TNF-\u03b1, but upregulated in a cell-type-specific manner by TGF-beta and menadione, respectively.\nAs one of the lung-abundant extracellular antioxidant proteins 33 , GPX3 has the potential to fulfil an important protective function in the lung, but regulation and localization of GPX3 in ILD has received little attention. The mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is typically used as a model for ILD. Using this model we found that Gpx3 was expressed by bronchial epithelial cells, secreted in active form into the ELF, and upregulated in lung fibrosis both in BALF and in lung tissue. In samples from IPF patients, we found significant upregulation of GPX3 in total tissue homogenates. Furthermore, we could show that primary human bronchial epithelial cells und fibroblasts express GPX3 in culture. This is in agreement with a number of previous studies that showed expression of GPX3 by bronchial epithelial cells and presence in the ELF 36 47 . More recent studies employing immunofluorescent stainings, however, failed to show expression in bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and presence of Gpx3 in the lung was mostly attributed to serum Gpx3 supplied primarily by the kidneys 32 33 48 . Our data highlight that GPX3 is expressed and secreted by mouse and human bronchial epithelial cells already under physiological conditions and increased in mouse and human lung fibrosis.\nIn mouse and human lung tissue sections, our results demonstrate localization of GPX3 to the subepithelial and subendothelial basement membrane, in agreement with previous studies showing association of GPX3 with the basement membrane 32 33 48 . It has been proposed that also this basement membrane-associated GPX3 is mostly kidney-derived 32 , whereas our results suggest that bronchial epithelial cells secrete GPX3 and thus contribute to the subepithelial basement membrane-associated population. This is further underlined by the detection of GPX3 in ELF following lung injury, both in the mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and in ILD, in particular in HP and sarcoidosis. However in our small cohort, GPX3 levels were neither significantly associated with a particular ILD nor correlated with lung function, as proposed by the animal study. However, clearly a larger patient cohort would be necessary to ultimately rule out possible correlations.\nImportantly, we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, HP, and IPF, GPX3 additionally localizes to the interstitial matrix in lung fibrosis. This raises the possibility that GPX3 might protect interstitial fibrotic ECM from oxidative damage with a potential impact on the resolvability of fibrotic matrix. Hence, the function of ECM-bound GPX3 clearly warrants further investigation.\nIn IPF patients, interestingly, GPX3 levels were significantly increased in total lung homogenate, but consistently low in BALF. This might argue for an altered compartmentalization of GPX3 in IPF,  e.g.  a specific increase of fibroblast-specific  GPX3  expression or a spatial shift from apically secreted soluble GPX3 to interstitial matrix-associated GPX3, reminiscent of what has been observed in a mouse model of influenza pneumonia 33 .\nIn the mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, Gpx3 levels in tissue and BALF were increased in the inflammatory (day 3-7) and fibrotic (day 14-28) phase 35 46 , but had returned to baseline after resolution of fibrosis at day 56. Levels of Gpx3 as well as Gpx activity in BALF were highest in the inflammatory phase (day 7) of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, suggesting upregulation by inflammatory rather than profibrotic mediators ( cf .  Fig. 1B,C,E ). Also, GPX3 has been found upregulated in the ELF of individuals with asthma and chronic beryllium disease, the latter an ILD characterized by granulomatous lung inflammation, similar to sarcoidosis 47 49 . Equally, our own data show higher levels of GPX3 in ILD typically associated with an inflammatory component (HP, sarcoidosis) than in ILD which are considered less associated with inflammation as IPF and SRIF ( cf .  Fig. 3 ). This lead us to investigate whether TNF-\u03b1 as a classical proinflammatory cytokine and TGF-beta as central profibrotic stimulus regulated GPX3 expression in primary human bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts.\nIn both lung cell types TNF-\u03b1 strongly suppressed GPX3 expression. This was an unexpected result insofar that GPX3 is considered a classical Nrf2-induced gene and TNF-\u03b1 has repeatedly been reported to upregulate other Nrf2 target genes in various cell types including leukocytes of the myeloid lineage, vascular endothelial cells, and osteoblasts 50 51 52 53 54 . However, to our knowledge, only one study has assessed the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on GPX3 expression and shown that, in adipose tissue, GPX3 expression is markedly decreased by TNF-\u03b1, in agreement with our observation 55 .\nThis is the first study to show that GPX3 is regulated by TGF-beta in a cell-type-specific manner. TGF-beta treatment led to a moderate upregulation of GPX3 secretion in phBEC, but to downregulation of GPX3 on both transcript and protein level in phLF. TGF-beta has been shown to inactivate Nrf2 and repress expression of various Nrf2 target genes in both mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells 56 57 , but also upregulation of antioxidant genes by TGF-beta has been reported 58 59 . Our results emphasize the importance of the cellular context for modulation of the oxidative stress response by TGF-beta.\nInterestingly, menadione appeared to be more effective as inducer of the oxidative stress response in phLF than in phBEC. 10 \u03bcM menadione, a concentration which has been shown to upregulate GPX3 transcription in an immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line 60 , consistently induced expression of both GPX3 and NQO1 in phLF while the effects in phBEC were more variable.\nIn summary, our  in vitro  results suggest, that TGF-beta and oxidative stress contribute to increased GPX3 expression in lung fibrosis in a cell-type-specific manner, upregulating GPX3 in bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts, respectively. In contrast, our findings uniformly rule out TNF-\u03b1 as positive regulator of GPX3 in ILD. Clearly, other factors important for ILD pathogenesis, not assessed in the present study, might play a role in regulation of GPX3 expression, as  e.g.  hypoxia, other proinflammatory mediators, or cigarette smoke 49 61 . As to the latter, it is worth mentioning that in all ILD patients assessed in this study, there was a non-significant trend ( cf .  Fig. 3E ) for never-smokers to exhibit higher GPX3 levels in BALF than patients with a smoking history. Similarly, albeit also in a small cohort, Comhair  et al . reported that never-smoking patients with chronic beryllium disease (CBD) displayed higher extracellular GPX activity in BALF than ex-smoking CBD patients 49 .\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate that, under normal conditions, GPX3 is expressed and secreted in active form into the ELF by bronchial epithelial cells. In addition to localization to basement membranes reported previously, GPX3 can be expressed by lung fibroblasts and associate with interstitial fibrotic ECM, suggesting a protective anti-oxidant function in this compartment. Our findings further indicate that TGF-beta and oxidative stress, but not TNF-\u03b1, contribute to upregulation of GPX3 in lung fibrosis in a cell-type-specific manner.\n"], "ner": [[[6, 9, "DISEASE"], [229, 233, "GENE"], [238, 247, "RELATION"], [292, 305, "DISEASE"], [341, 352, "DISEASE"], [395, 398, "DISEASE"], [409, 413, "GENE"], [494, 498, "GENE"], [713, 717, "GENE"], [796, 801, "GENE"], [853, 861, "GENE"], [959, 963, "GENE"], [1073, 1077, "GENE"], [1081, 1084, "DISEASE"], [1153, 1166, "DISEASE"], [1200, 1203, "DISEASE"], [1236, 1240, "GENE"], [1328, 1339, "RELATION"], [1343, 1356, "DISEASE"], [1406, 1409, "DISEASE"], [1441, 1453, "RELATION"], [1457, 1461, "GENE"], [1588, 1592, "GENE"], [1686, 1690, "GENE"], [1910, 1914, "GENE"], [1958, 1962, "GENE"], [2032, 2036, "GENE"], [2152, 2161, "RELATION"], [2181, 2194, "DISEASE"], [2277, 2281, "GENE"], [2399, 2403, "GENE"], [2507, 2511, "GENE"], [2610, 2614, "GENE"], [2744, 2748, "GENE"], [2824, 2837, "DISEASE"], [2845, 2848, "DISEASE"], [2874, 2885, "DISEASE"], [2916, 2920, "GENE"], [2984, 2987, "DISEASE"], [3247, 3260, "DISEASE"], [3270, 3273, "DISEASE"], [3275, 3279, "GENE"], [3333, 3346, "DISEASE"], [3381, 3385, "GENE"], [3546, 3550, "GENE"], [3594, 3597, "DISEASE"], [3623, 3627, "GENE"], [3628, 3663, "RELATION"], [3776, 3780, "GENE"], [3784, 3787, "DISEASE"], [3840, 3844, "GENE"], [3907, 3911, "GENE"], [3946, 3950, "GENE"]], [[4075, 4088, "DISEASE"], [4090, 4094, "GENE"], [[4095, 4121], [4101, 4135], "RELATION"], [4284, 4288, "GENE"], [4389, 4402, "DISEASE"], [4507, 4511, "GENE"], [4527, 4538, "RELATION"], [4570, 4576, "DISEASE"], [4581, 4606, "DISEASE"], [4622, 4625, "DISEASE"], [4687, 4698, "DISEASE"], [4734, 4747, "RELATION"], [4751, 4755, "GENE"], [4759, 4762, "DISEASE"], [4820, 4831, "DISEASE"], [4841, 4844, "DISEASE"], [4903, 4906, "DISEASE"], [4970, 4975, "GENE"], [5020, 5028, "GENE"], [5071, 5075, "GENE"], [5172, 5177, "GENE"], [5198, 5202, "GENE"], [5258, 5262, "GENE"], [5289, 5293, "GENE"], [5311, 5316, "GENE"], [5366, 5370, "GENE"], [5581, 5586, "GENE"], [5590, 5594, "GENE"], [5641, 5645, "GENE"], [5682, 5687, "GENE"], [5765, 5769, "GENE"], [5786, 5794, "GENE"], [5827, 5835, "GENE"], [5880, 5884, "GENE"], [5930, 5934, "GENE"], [5981, 5989, "GENE"], [6019, 6023, "GENE"], [6058, 6062, "GENE"], [6177, 6185, "GENE"], [6324, 6332, "GENE"], [6524, 6528, "GENE"], [6638, 6642, "GENE"], [6647, 6651, "GENE"], [6756, 6764, "GENE"], [[6800, 6815], [6809, 6825], "RELATION"], [6810, 6814, "GENE"], [6829, 6842, "DISEASE"], [6888, 6892, "GENE"], [7012, 7017, "GENE"], [7043, 7047, "GENE"], [7051, 7054, "DISEASE"], [7093, 7096, "DISEASE"], [7181, 7185, "GENE"], [7330, 7333, "DISEASE"], [7455, 7459, "GENE"], [7614, 7639, "DISEASE"], [7641, 7644, "DISEASE"], [7714, 7717, "DISEASE"], [7793, 7797, "GENE"], [7954, 7958, "GENE"]], [[8144, 8152, "GENE"], [8183, 8188, "GENE"], [8204, 8216, "RELATION"], [8220, 8224, "GENE"], [8228, 8241, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[229, 233, 292, 305, "increased expression"], [229, 233, 341, 352, "increased expression"], [229, 233, 395, 398, "increased expression"], [1236, 1240, 1343, 1356, "increased expression"], [1457, 1461, 1406, 1409, "increased expression"], [2032, 2036, 2181, 2194, "increased expression"], [3623, 3627, 3594, 3597, "increased expression"]], [[4090, 4094, 4075, 4088, "increased expression"], [4507, 4511, 4570, 4576, "increased expression"], [4507, 4511, 4581, 4606, "increased expression"], [4751, 4755, 4759, 4762, "increased expression"], [6810, 6814, 6829, 6842, "increased expression"]], [[8220, 8224, 8228, 8241, "increased expression"]]], "triplets": [[[229, 233, 292, 305, 238, 247], [229, 233, 341, 352, 238, 247], [229, 233, 395, 398, 238, 247], [1236, 1240, 1343, 1356, 1328, 1339], [1457, 1461, 1406, 1409, 1441, 1453], [2032, 2036, 2181, 2194, 2152, 2161], [3623, 3627, 3594, 3597, 3628, 3663]], [[4090, 4094, 4075, 4088, [4095, 4121], [4101, 4135]], [4507, 4511, 4570, 4576, 4527, 4538], [4507, 4511, 4581, 4606, 4527, 4538], [4751, 4755, 4759, 4762, 4734, 4747], [6810, 6814, 6829, 6842, [6800, 6815], [6809, 6825]]], [[8220, 8224, 8228, 8241, 8204, 8216]]], "triplets_text": [[["GPX3", "lung fibrosis", "increased"], ["GPX3", "sarcoidosis", "increased"], ["GPX3", "IPF", "increased"], ["Gpx3", "lung fibrosis", "upregulated"], ["GPX3", "IPF", "upregulation"], ["GPX3", "lung fibrosis", "increased"], ["GPX3", "IPF", "levels were significantly increased"]], [["Gpx3", "lung fibrosis", "levels were increased"], ["GPX3", "asthma", "upregulated"], ["GPX3", "chronic beryllium disease", "upregulated"], ["GPX3", "ILD", "higher levels"], ["GPX3", "lung fibrosis", "increased expression"]], [["GPX3", "lung fibrosis", "upregulation"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2], "sentences": ["\nMany ILDs are triggered by oxidative insults to the airways, but regulation of extracellular antioxidant proteins has gained little attention in this context. In the present study, we show that levels of the antioxidant protein GPX3 are increased in BALF and tissue during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, as well as in BALF of some HP and sarcoidosis patients and in total lung homogenates of IPF patients. GPX3 was expressed by bronchial epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts. While GPX3 localized mainly to the basement membrane of the bronchial epithelium and endothelium in healthy mouse and human tissue, we found localization also to the interstitial ECM in fibrotic tissue compartments. Finally, GPX3 expression in bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts was downregulated by TNF-\u03b1, but upregulated in a cell-type-specific manner by TGF-beta and menadione, respectively.\nAs one of the lung-abundant extracellular antioxidant proteins 33 , GPX3 has the potential to fulfil an important protective function in the lung, but regulation and localization of GPX3 in ILD has received little attention. The mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is typically used as a model for ILD. Using this model we found that Gpx3 was expressed by bronchial epithelial cells, secreted in active form into the ELF, and upregulated in lung fibrosis both in BALF and in lung tissue. In samples from IPF patients, we found significant upregulation of GPX3 in total tissue homogenates. Furthermore, we could show that primary human bronchial epithelial cells und fibroblasts express GPX3 in culture. This is in agreement with a number of previous studies that showed expression of GPX3 by bronchial epithelial cells and presence in the ELF 36 47 . More recent studies employing immunofluorescent stainings, however, failed to show expression in bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and presence of Gpx3 in the lung was mostly attributed to serum Gpx3 supplied primarily by the kidneys 32 33 48 . Our data highlight that GPX3 is expressed and secreted by mouse and human bronchial epithelial cells already under physiological conditions and increased in mouse and human lung fibrosis.\nIn mouse and human lung tissue sections, our results demonstrate localization of GPX3 to the subepithelial and subendothelial basement membrane, in agreement with previous studies showing association of GPX3 with the basement membrane 32 33 48 . It has been proposed that also this basement membrane-associated GPX3 is mostly kidney-derived 32 , whereas our results suggest that bronchial epithelial cells secrete GPX3 and thus contribute to the subepithelial basement membrane-associated population. This is further underlined by the detection of GPX3 in ELF following lung injury, both in the mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and in ILD, in particular in HP and sarcoidosis. However in our small cohort, GPX3 levels were neither significantly associated with a particular ILD nor correlated with lung function, as proposed by the animal study. However, clearly a larger patient cohort would be necessary to ultimately rule out possible correlations.\nImportantly, we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, HP, and IPF, GPX3 additionally localizes to the interstitial matrix in lung fibrosis. This raises the possibility that GPX3 might protect interstitial fibrotic ECM from oxidative damage with a potential impact on the resolvability of fibrotic matrix.

Levels of Gpx3 as well as Gpx activity in BALF were highest in the inflammatory phase (day 7) of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, suggesting upregulation by inflammatory rather than profibrotic mediators ( cf .  Fig. 1B,C,E ). Also, GPX3 has been found upregulated in the ELF of individuals with asthma and chronic beryllium disease, the latter an ILD characterized by granulomatous lung inflammation, similar to sarcoidosis 47 49 .

Both groups were well-matched in terms of age and marriage duration. However, BMI has been found to be significantly greater (p value<0.01) in PCOS group. Therefore comparisons between women with PCOS and non-PCOS were performed after additional adjustment for BMI. Fasting and post-prandial (PP) insulin was found to be significantly higher (p value<0.0001) in PCOS population along with HOMA2-IR values (PCOS: 2.39\u00b10.91 vs. non-PCOS: 1.51\u00b11.34). Fasting levels of homocysteine (\u00b5mol/L) was significantly higher (p value<0.0001) in women with PCOS (PCOS: 13.14\u00b15.04vs. non-PCOS: 8.39\u00b12.22) havingprevioushistory of RPL .  ( Table 1 ). Based on characteristic phenotypes, the patients were stratified on the presence or absence of PCOS while subsequent stratification was based on plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) and IR.The rate of spontaneous abortion in hyperhomocysteinemic cohort (70.63%) of the PCOS women was significantly higher (p value<0.04) when compared to it's IR-subgroup (56.34%).Moreover, rate of miscarriage between the hyperhomocysteinemic populations of both groups (PCOS:70.63% &non-PCOS: 57.26%), were significantly higher(p value<0.008; p value<0.03) than that of the corresponding normo-homocysteinemic segments (PCOS: 29.36% & non-PCOS: 42.73%) ( Figure 1 ).\nA stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrates homocysteine as the independent variable, resulting in a multiple R of 0.317, with a mean square for the regression 158.76, F\u200a=\u200a6.805, p value<0.01. Controlling for other variables, HOMA2-IR (r\u200a=\u200a0.196, p value<0.029) and PP insulin (r\u200a=\u200a0.421, p value<0.001) levels emerged as the most significant parameters affecting homocysteine levels while BMI (r\u200a=\u200a0.113, p value<0.21) proved insignificant affecting levels of homocysteine. A significant correlation was noted between homocysteine levels and a history of prior miscarriage (<2) in women with PCOS (r\u200a=\u200a0.343, p value<0.05). The correlation maintains significance even after controlling HOMA2-IR values (r\u200a=\u200a0.342, p value<0.02) proving HHcy rather than IR to have a stronger association with history of prior miscarriage in these women.\nTo strengthen our outcome we developed a probabilistic graphical model ( Figure 2 ) with the help of Bayesian network. A most likely diagnosis of 34.37% of unconditional probability has been observed in women experiencing miscarriage.

Both groups were well-matched in terms of age and marriage duration. However, BMI has been found to be significantly greater (p value<0.01) in PCOS group. Therefore comparisons between women with PCOS and non-PCOS were performed after additional adjustment for BMI. Fasting and post-prandial (PP) insulin was found to be significantly higher (p value<0.0001) in PCOS population along with HOMA2-IR values (PCOS: 2.39\u00b10.91 vs. non-PCOS: 1.51\u00b11.34). Fasting levels of homocysteine (\u00b5mol/L) was significantly higher (p value<0.0001) in women with PCOS (PCOS: 13.14\u00b15.04vs. non-PCOS: 8.39\u00b12.22) havingprevioushistory of RPL .  ( Table 1 ). Based on characteristic phenotypes, the patients were stratified on the presence or absence of PCOS while subsequent stratification was based on plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) and IR.The rate of spontaneous abortion in hyperhomocysteinemic cohort (70.63%) of the PCOS women was significantly higher (p value<0.04) when compared to it's IR-subgroup (56.34%).Moreover, rate of miscarriage between the hyperhomocysteinemic populations of both groups (PCOS:70.63% &non-PCOS: 57.26%), were significantly higher(p value<0.008; p value<0.03) than that of the corresponding normo-homocysteinemic segments (PCOS: 29.36% & non-PCOS: 42.73%) ( Figure 1 ).\nA stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrates homocysteine as the independent variable, resulting in a multiple R of 0.317, with a mean square for the regression 158.76, F\u200a=\u200a6.805, p value<0.01. Controlling for other variables, HOMA2-IR (r\u200a=\u200a0.196, p value<0.029) and PP insulin (r\u200a=\u200a0.421, p value<0.001) levels emerged as the most significant parameters affecting homocysteine levels while BMI (r\u200a=\u200a0.113, p value<0.21) proved insignificant affecting levels of homocysteine. A significant correlation was noted between homocysteine levels and a history of prior miscarriage (<2) in women with PCOS (r\u200a=\u200a0.343, p value<0.05). The correlation maintains significance even after controlling HOMA2-IR values (r\u200a=\u200a0.342, p value<0.02) proving HHcy rather than IR to have a stronger association with history of prior miscarriage in these women.\nTo strengthen our outcome we developed a probabilistic graphical model ( Figure 2 ) with the help of Bayesian network. A most likely diagnosis of 34.37% of unconditional probability has been observed in women experiencing miscarriage. However, the presence of plasma homocysteine increased the probability to 43.32%, while in its absence, the conditional miscarriage probability decreased to 29.03%.

TSH, PRL, FSH, LH, testosterone (total), insulin and homocysteine (Hcy) were assayed in serum with automated chemiluminescence assay system using an Immulite\u00ae platform (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were <10% for all assays performed. Glucose levels were measured using VITROS dry chemistry system\u00ae (Ortho-clinical diagnostics, France). Definition of normal concentrations of plasma homocysteine differs substantially between different studies (5 to 16 \u00b5mol/L) although 12 \u00b5mol/L were set as the cut-off limit for HHcy. IR was determined using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA2-IR) using the Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit calculator ( http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk ; University of Oxford, UK). (HOMA2-IR: (fasting insulin\u00d7fasting glucose)/22.5). Patients with HOMA2-IR greater than 2.1 were classified as IR  [25] . Outcome of the pregnancy was recorded at the end of the gestational period. Women who did not attend the clinic were contacted by telephone or letter to document information about the outcome of their pregnancy.\nDevelopment of the probabilistic model\nA probabilistic model has been developed to compare the variables and their relationships with the help of bayesian network for diagnosis of RPL. The selected database available to us included 243 records where each of the records was described by four (PCOS, BMI, HOMA2-IR and HHcy) different features established as causal factor for miscarriage, which are binary in nature denoting presence or absence of a feature. The model consisted of eight nodes and each node corresponding to a variable namely fasting insulin, post prandial (PP) insulin, PP blood sugar, fasting blood sugar, HOMA2-IR, Hcy, BMI and PCOS. A dependency structure has been developed to correlate the association of IR, HHcy, PCOS and obesity with RPL in single or in combination. Since the above pathologies are influenced by fasting insulin, PP insulin, PP blood sugar and fasting blood sugar, hence all these relationships were incorporated in the model. The structure of the proposed model is shown in  Figure 2 . After initialization of all conditional probability densities with a uniform distribution, an expectation maximization algorithm was run to estimate the parameters from this given data for the above probabilistic graphical model. After the estimation process is over, we obtained the estimated parameters from the model and computed the probability distribution given by the data.\nStatistical Analyses\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the normality of distribution. All results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, unless otherwise stated. Differences between the two groups were evaluated with use of analysis of variance and chi-square test, as applicable. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to calculate correlation between paired data sets.\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis and SAMIAM software available at  http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/samiam/  (University of California, Los Angles, U.S.A.) was used for the development of the model.

Patients were selected from the women attending the infertility clinic from March 2008 through February 2011. During this period, data of four hundred and sixty five women were approached for the study. Two hundred and ninety one PCOS women as diagnosed in accordance with the Rotterdam criteria  [23]  and two hundred and four non- PCOS subjects form the total cohort. Two hundred and twenty seven PCOS and one hundred forty one non-PCOS subjects gave written informed consent and were initially enrolled. PCOS was diagnosed if at least two of the following criteria were present: oligo/amenorrhoea, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism and PCO on USG. Other common causes of hyperandrogenism (prolactinoma, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cushing syndrome and virilizing ovarian/adrenal tumors) were excluded. The selection of the patient cohort in the PCOS arm was based on the exclusion criteria: ultrasonography (USG)-documented uterine anatomical anomalies, chromosomal defects as evaluated by peripheral blood karyotyping of both partners, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, positive tests for APS (lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies), infections including Toxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus, and unavailability of relevant clinical and laboratory data. One hundred and twenty six women met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-four subjects were excluded from the non-PCOS arm on the basis of uterine anomalies, hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus and unavailability of relevant laboratory data. The non-PCOS group of one-hundred and seventeen subjects were represented mostly by those with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage, but also included 3 women who had their miscarriages attributed to male factors.

{"doc_key": "3660299_Discussion", "text": ["\nRPL is found in 1-5% of couples desiring pregnancy. Despite various efforts to find an etiologic factor for RPL, \u223c50% of these cases remain unexplained. A plethora of factors have been addressed that are associated with the pathophysiology of RPL in PCOS. The common metabolic derailments of the syndrome like obesity and IR have been implicated as individual risk factors for RPL  [26] . Recent evidences suggest another metabolic component, HHcy, to be a frequent associate in subjects with PCOS. Moreover, mild-to-moderate HHcy has been suggested as a possible threat to women with habitual abortions or placental abruption  [27] . Hence, the heterogeneous syndrome comprises different metabolic factors (IR, obesity, HHcy) which can cause hindrance in isolation or combination for the maintenance of pregnancy. Here we report, HHcy  per se  has got a higher probable association (43.32%) with miscarriage in a small cohort of women diagnosed with RPL.\nTwo separate populations suffering from RPL were addressed in this investigation: one diagnosed with PCOS, while other was the non-PCOS segment. Both populations were represented with occurrence of HHcy, obesity or IR, which were the phenotypes the further stratifications based upon.\nThere is no international consensus regarding the establishment of a cut-off point for HHcy and hence different epidemiological studies set up dissimilar cut-off values. However, Hcy values of between 10 and 12 \u00b5mol/L in pregnant individuals are considered borderline elevated  [28] . Fasting plasma total Hcy value of 12 \u00b5mol/L was therefore, set as the cut-off limit for the present investigation. Evaluation of the impact of different degrees of obesity on the risk of recurrent miscarriage demonstrated that not a mild increase in the BMI (25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ), but obesity characterized by BMI>30 kg/m 2 , increases the risk of miscarriage  [24] . We therefore set BMI value of 30 kg/m 2  as the cut-off to differentiate obese from non-obese population.\nRate of miscarriage between the hyperhomocysteinemic populations of both groups were significantly higher than that of the corresponding normo-homocysteinemic segments (p value<0.0001; p value<0.008). Moreover, the subjects in our study showed a significant correlation (r\u200a=\u200a0.343, p value<0.05) with the rate of miscarriage in the PCOS population diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria which achieved a greater correlation (r\u200a=\u200a0.342, p value<0.02) after controlling for the HOMA2-IR values. This suggests that HHcy may set the ground behind the risk of RPL irrespective of IR/non-IR subjects. Alongside, it also raises the issue concerning earlier studies that whether HHcy was segregated from the insulin resistant population to envisage its individual role to RPL.\nIn the current investigation, a linear regression analysis described homocysteine as the independent variable affecting RPL. However, the connection between IR and HHcy stands tall as HOMA2-IR (r\u200a=\u200a0.196, p value<0.029) and PP insulin (r\u200a=\u200a0.421, p value<0.001) levels emerged as the most significant parameters after controlling for other variables, affecting homocysteine levels with no significant correlation with BMI. We however didn't take interest to evaluate miscarriage owing to obesity as a mild increase in the BMI (25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ) found in our patient cohort do not really impact on the risk of recurrent miscarriage  [24] .\nBayesian networks have been around in biomedicine and health-care for more than a decade and have become increasingly popular for handling the uncertain knowledge involved in establishing diagnoses of disease. For controlling the diagnostic complexity in the field of RPL, a proper understanding of the processes is important as is the ability to reason about them. It is apparent that the numbers of variables are many and to come to a conclusion as to which variable(s) is/are playing leading part, network analysis definitely helps under such circumstances. From the learned model, a most likely diagnosis of 34.37% of unconditional probability has been observed in women experiencing miscarriage. While using a homocysteine threshold of 12 \u00b5mol/L, HOMA2-IR: 2.1, BMI: 30 kg/m 2  and on the presence or absence of PCOS, we found that HHcy has got the maximum probable associate ship with the rate of miscarriage in women in Kolkata, India. This was supported by the ROC-AUC predictive accuracy expressed, as it increased slightly to 0.778 while using a homocysteine threshold of 12 \u00b5mol/L.\nA high proportion of PCOS patients have a greater risk for spontaneous abortion due to the individual anatomic defect or the confounding factors associated with it  [26] . The comparison among PCOS and non-PCOS patients in the current study gave us opportunity to cue at the anatomical problem alone. However, we did not find any significant associate-ship of PCO morphology in the designed probabilistic model.\nThe mechanism linking IR with RPL may be complicated. Hyperinsulinemia adversely affects the pre-implantation environment by decreasing the expression of glycodelin and IGF-binding protein-1  [29]  which may play a role in inhibiting the endometrial immune response of the embryo, and seems to facilitate adhesion processes at the feto-maternal interface. A positive relationship between HOMA2-IR and spontaneous abortion in quite a few numbers of studies suggest IR as a significant predictor of pregnancy wastage  [15] ,  [16] . Elevated PAI-I (an endogenous inhibitor of fibrinolysis) levels have an independent association-ship with recurrent miscarriages in women in this respect  [21] . A recent report documented in patients receiving metformin that PAI-1is positively correlated with the HOMA score  [30] . In the small patient cohort selected, HOMA2-IR stands as the second most important individual causal factor to be linked with the risk of RPL as analysed by the ROC curve and the networking model.\nIncreased thrombosis caused by HHcy resulting microthrombi formation in the vessel bed of the placenta can impair sustained placental function  [3] . These microthrombi may cause multiple placental infarctions and subsequently maternal complications of pregnancy. Apart from the thrombogenic effect of elevated Hcy on pregnancy in women with PCOS, few recent studies have also implicated the adverse effect of high serum or follicular fluid Hcy levels on defect in folliculogenesis  [31] , embryo quality  [32] , oocyte numbers and oocyte maturation  [33] , that may have future bearings on the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Thus, homocysteine may be responsible for more reasons than one for the increased miscarriage rates.\nThe current study has some limitations. The gold standard for establishing IR is euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp which has not been in routine clinical practice. Instead, we used HOMA2-IR calculation which is often used as a surrogate marker for IR  [34] . Along with this, the variables by which homocysteine levels are influenced like smoking, renal function, vitamin B status and enzyme dysfunction states were not examined in this study. However, all of the patients in our clinic are actively discouraged from smoking.\nIn conclusion, HHcy mediated RPL is one of the most significant contributor which plays a substantial role in spontaneous abortion of sub-continental women. Moreover, various studies report the role of folic acid  [35] ,  [36] , Vit B6 & B12 supplementation  [37]  and LMWH (unpublished observations) in improving pregnancy outcomes in women with HHcy. Thus, the role of identification and active treatment of Hcy in these women at high risk of subsequent miscarriage should be emphasised upon. Further studies are required to confirm our findings and to assess the efficacy of vitamin supplementation &/or anticoagulation in prevention of further miscarriage in women with HHcy.\n"], "ner": [[[251, 255, "DISEASE"], [311, 318, "DISEASE"], [444, 448, "DISEASE"], [494, 498, "DISEASE"], [527, 531, "DISEASE"], [713, 720, "DISEASE"], [722, 726, "DISEASE"], [832, 836, "DISEASE"], [1058, 1062, "DISEASE"], [1088, 1092, "DISEASE"], [1155, 1159, "DISEASE"], [1161, 1168, "DISEASE"], [1329, 1333, "DISEASE"], [1691, 1698, "DISEASE"], [2331, 2335, "DISEASE"], [2518, 2522, "DISEASE"], [2677, 2681, "DISEASE"], [2939, 2943, "DISEASE"], [3263, 3270, "DISEASE"]], [[4232, 4236, "DISEASE"], [4252, 4256, "DISEASE"], [4529, 4533, "DISEASE"], [4701, 4705, "DISEASE"], [4714, 4718, "DISEASE"], [4974, 4990, "DISEASE"], [5942, 5952, "DISEASE"], [5963, 5967, "DISEASE"], [6274, 6278, "DISEASE"], [7213, 7217, "DISEASE"], [7545, 7549, "DISEASE"], [7872, 7876, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], []], "triplets": [[], []], "triplets_text": [[], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nRPL is found in 1-5% of couples desiring pregnancy. Despite various efforts to find an etiologic factor for RPL, \u223c50% of these cases remain unexplained. A plethora of factors have been addressed that are associated with the pathophysiology of RPL in PCOS. The common metabolic derailments of the syndrome like obesity and IR have been implicated as individual risk factors for RPL  [26] . Recent evidences suggest another metabolic component, HHcy, to be a frequent associate in subjects with PCOS. Moreover, mild-to-moderate HHcy has been suggested as a possible threat to women with habitual abortions or placental abruption  [27] . Hence, the heterogeneous syndrome comprises different metabolic factors (IR, obesity, HHcy) which can cause hindrance in isolation or combination for the maintenance of pregnancy. Here we report, HHcy  per se  has got a higher probable association (43.32%) with miscarriage in a small cohort of women diagnosed with RPL.\nTwo separate populations suffering from RPL were addressed in this investigation: one diagnosed with PCOS, while other was the non-PCOS segment. Both populations were represented with occurrence of HHcy, obesity or IR, which were the phenotypes the further stratifications based upon.\nThere is no international consensus regarding the establishment of a cut-off point for HHcy and hence different epidemiological studies set up dissimilar cut-off values. However, Hcy values of between 10 and 12 \u00b5mol/L in pregnant individuals are considered borderline elevated  [28] . Fasting plasma total Hcy value of 12 \u00b5mol/L was therefore, set as the cut-off limit for the present investigation. Evaluation of the impact of different degrees of obesity on the risk of recurrent miscarriage demonstrated that not a mild increase in the BMI (25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ), but obesity characterized by BMI>30 kg/m 2 , increases the risk of miscarriage  [24] . We therefore set BMI value of 30 kg/m 2  as the cut-off to differentiate obese from non-obese population.\nRate of miscarriage between the hyperhomocysteinemic populations of both groups were significantly higher than that of the corresponding normo-homocysteinemic segments (p value<0.0001; p value<0.008). Moreover, the subjects in our study showed a significant correlation (r\u200a=\u200a0.343, p value<0.05) with the rate of miscarriage in the PCOS population diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria which achieved a greater correlation (r\u200a=\u200a0.342, p value<0.02) after controlling for the HOMA2-IR values. This suggests that HHcy may set the ground behind the risk of RPL irrespective of IR/non-IR subjects.

Among the several hypotheses, insulin resistance (IR), obesity and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) play significant role/s in RPL. This study was conducted to assess the link between elevated levels of homocysteine and IR in PCOS-associated women with RPL in Kolkata, India. A retrospective study was conducted of one hundred and twenty six PCOS women (<30 years) who experienced two or more spontaneous abortions during the first trimester presenting to Institute of Reproductive Medicine (IRM) in Kolkata during the period of March 2008 through February 2011. One hundred and seventeen non-PCOS subjects with matching age range were randomly chosen as controls. Incidence of HHcy and IR was 70.63% (n\u200a=\u200a89) and 56.34% (n\u200a=\u200a71), respectively, in RPL-affected PCOS population which was significantly higher (p<0.04; p<0.0001) when compared to the non-PCOS set (HHcy: 57.26%; IR: 6.83%). Rates of miscarriage were significantly higher (p<0.008; p<0.03) in hyperhomocysteinemia-induced miscarriage when compared to the normohomocysteinemic segment (PCOS: 70.63% vs.29.36% & non-PCOS: 57.26% vs. 42.73%) along with the insulin resistant (p<0.04; p<0.0001) population (PCOS: 70.63% vs. 56.34% & non-PCOS: 57.26% vs. 6.83%) in both groups.

{"doc_key": "3320601_Discussion", "text": ["\nWe anticipated that a low dose of live pneumococci delivered intra-nasally would lead to colonisation and thus augmented mucosal and systemic responses to pneumococci. Colonisation was not achieved in this study but we have shown that human inoculation with a low dose of live pneumococci elicits specific mucosal responses in the absence of carriage. Healthy adult volunteers with detectable humoral and cellular immunity to pneumococci prior to inoculation showed increased immunoglobulin responses in NW and BAL but not blood 6 weeks after experimental bacterial inoculation. In particular, concentrations of IgG measured following inoculation with 23F were increased compared to baseline observations in NW and BAL but not in serum using a whole bacteria ELISA. Concentrations of IgA measured following inoculation with 23F or 6B were increased compared to baseline observations in NW but not in BAL or serum. These responses did not include IgG or IgA to pneumococcal capsule. We measured IgG responses in NW, BAL and serum towards four pneumococcal proteins. We found that IgG anti-PspA was significantly elevated in NW (following 6B challenge) and BAL (following 23F challenge) and accounted in part to the elevated responses seen towards whole pneumococci. Inoculation was associated with an increase in the absolute count and percentage of mucosal memory CD4 T cells for the 23F cohort but not with an increase in paired antigen-specific cellular responses in either group.\nNasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci occurs early in life, frequently in infancy  [5]  and less commonly in adult life  [40] . The most dramatic reduction in carriage and also disease rate occurs in the second year of life  [41]  independent of capsular serotype  [7] . Humoral and cellular responses to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide and protein antigens develop during this time. These immunological developments contribute towards a much lower incidence of pneumococcal mucosal and invasive disease in older children and young adults than in infants  [41] ,  [42] . Repeated episodes of carriage and possibly pneumococcal exposure  [13]  are thought to boost these important defences.\nExperimental human pneumococcal carriage (EHPC) in adults offers the platform to measure these responses  [43] . EHPC in immune adults has been previously reported  [25] ,  [44]  but there has been no previous quantitative report of the mucosal humoral and cellular immune response to challenge not resulting in carriage. Most adult exposures to pneumococcus do not result in carriage and indeed in our experimental pneumococcal inoculations, only one healthy adult progressed to carriage. This result is surprising given that the inoculated dose per naris for both cohorts in our study ( Table 1 ) is similar (23F) or higher (6B) than the CFU dose described by McCool and Weiser  [25]  for their colonised (12,000\u00b15,477/naris) and uncolonised (7,250\u00b14,062/naris) groups. Colonisation success rate will depend on challenge dose but also on the sensitivity of detection, exposure to other non-/infectious agents, presence of co-morbidities, genetic factors, opacity (i.e. capsule expression) of the challenge strain  [45]  and study design.\nThe usefulness of the EHPC model depends on the sensitivity of assays for detection of carriage. Sample collection by nasal swab followed by enrichment for pneumococci using STGG medium and subsequent bacterial culture is the current gold standard method  [46] . A previous EHPC model used throat and nasal swab or wash with standard bacteriological culture media  [25] . We demonstrated that a NW sample is not only more comfortable for the volunteer but better than swabs for detecting upper respiratory flora  [30]  including pneumococcus  [47] . We employed a method combining NW collection and direct plating followed by storage in STGG broth at -80\u00b0C  [30] . A molecular approach to pneumococcal identification may yield greater sensitivity compared to culture  [48] ,  [49] , but it does not distinguish between carriage, which implies the presence of viable pneumococci, and retention of bacterial antigen from non-viable cells. A sophisticated molecular approach  [48]  will resolve these issues in the future but we cannot rule out that some volunteers described here were colonised below the detection limit of the current gold standard method. The major strength of this study, however, is that it focused on the immunological impact of a potentially infecting dose of pneumococcus  [25]  on healthy adults with proven previous natural pneumococcal exposure. We have been able to describe responses in the inoculated site (nasopharynx), distal airway and circulating blood.\nThe onset of carriage and acquisition of immunity in infants has been successfully modelled using mice. These models have shown that intra-nasal inoculation using live  [14] ,  [16] ,  [17] ,  [50]  or ethanol killed  [10]  pneumococci or recombinant proteins  [37] ,  [51] - [54]  (some with adjuvant) can elicit humoral and cellular immune responses that protect against subsequent colonisation  [14] ,  [16] - [18]  and/or disease  [16] ,  [17] . Murine models can dissect the relative contribution of humoral and cellular defence  [55]  but are a better model of infancy (naive response) than of adults with pre-existing memory responses. We have shown for the first time that levels of anti-protein IgG and IgA against pneumococus were boosted in both NW and BAL following intranasal challenge with pneumococci, though this depends on the serotype used. The implication of this finding is that exposure to low doses of pneumococcus is potentially immunising at the mucosal surface. A limitation of this study, however, is that the samples collected from the nasopharynx and lung are so dilute that functional measurement of the opsonophagocytic effect of the observed increase in immunoglobulin concentration is not currently possible. Previous studies in several laboratories including ours  [56]  have attempted to concentrate BAL in order to measure opsonic function. Concentration in this way allows binding to be determined but enhanced phagocytosis following immunisation has not been demonstrated.\nIt is interesting that there was no significant change in IgG or IgA to polysaccharide capsule following inoculation. This somewhat counter-intuitive observation is consistent with previous data showing a lack of BAL response to inhaled polysaccharide  [57] . Human experimental colonisation however enhanced serum polysaccharide responses in 5/6 volunteers  [25]  suggesting colonisation has a greater systemic immunising effect compared to challenge. Polysaccharide responses are initiated in the spleen and plasma cells are found in very low numbers in BAL. In the current study we know that bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx was achieved in less than 2 days (probably more rapidly) and it is therefore reasonable to suggest that polysaccharide and bacterial protein were not presented to critical sites or cells to enhance systemic immunity. IgG to polysaccharide capsule is a critical defence mechanism against invasive pneumococcal disease but is less important in defence against carriage  [18] . Our data suggest that experimental pneumococcal exposure without carriage does not augment this limb of systemic defence.\nWe showed altered mucosal responses to protein antigens, particularly choline bound proteins such as PspA. Using Western blot and whole cell ELISA, more IgG to pneumococcal protein was found after inoculation than before in both NW and BAL in the 23F cohort. The Western blots show a greater effect of inoculation on the choline binding proteins than on proteins extracted without choline chloride. Specific anti-protein ELISA was only able to detect a statistically significant difference in one of the 4 proteins tested (PspA) although NW IgG levels to the other three were all increased in the 6B challenged cohort. There are many pneumococcal surface-proteins that function as virulence factors and are sufficiently surface exposed to have vaccine potential. Some of these pneumococcal surface proteins, including PspA, PspC and PsaA, have been shown to have roles in adhesion and carriage and may vary in expression between pneumococcal isolates. Human anti-PspA responses elicited by intra-muscular vaccination with rPspA are protective against subsequent lethal challenge with heterologous pneumococci when passively transferred in murine models  [12]  and therefore the response seen in our 6B (NW) and 23F (BAL) cohort may be of functional significance. Both strains used in our study express PspA clade 1 similar to the PspA used for the ELISA. The absence of a NW response in the 23F cohort could be due to low PspA expression by the inoculated strain or adsorption of nasal antibodies to the inoculated bacteria. The concentration of IgG to PspA in mucosal samples is so diluted that direct functional assays or passive transfer experiments are unlikely to succeed. Alternatively, increased protection due to immunoglobulin responses in NW could be tested by repeated pneumococcal challenge of subjects with heterologous or homologous serotypes who develop experimental carriage and/or enhanced immunoglobulin responses on the first inoculation. This study is planned in our laboratory.\nMurine models have demonstrated that pneumococcal colonisation or vaccination results in the generation of memory CD4 T and B cells in both the circulation and at the mucosa. The effector CD4 T cell phenotype is mixed but includes IL-17  [14] ,  [37] ,  [58]  and/or IFNgamma  [37] ,  [51]  secreting T cells (T h-17 /T h-1 ). NW samples from healthy adults had very low cell counts in this study which is not surprising given that mucosal immune cells are found in specialised sub-mucosal lymphoid aggregates, best investigated in humans by using surgical explants  [59] . We were, however, able to demonstrate antigen-specific T cells producing cytokine in response to specific stimuli in BAL both before and after nasal inoculation. Pneumococcal challenge, however, did not alter the frequency of pneumococcal specific, cytokine secreting, CD4 T cells in BAL. The dose of pneumococci delivered to the lung in our non-colonised subjects is likely to have been very small and therefore the antigenic stimulus to lung during the inoculation period in our subjects will have been minimal. The lymphatic drainage of the nasopharynx is to the cervical lymph nodes whilst the lungs drain to the hilar nodes; we would therefore expect that antigen challenge of the nasopharynx would have limited impact on BAL lymphocytes. A recent murine model, however, has shown that viral upper respiratory tract infections lead to the migration of clonally-related populations of activated T cells to both upper  and  lower respiratory mucosal sites  [60] . These data suggests that measuring the proportion and phenotype of antigen specific T cells in the BAL mucosal compartment in humans may be similar to the proportion and phenotype of effector T cell populations present in the sub-mucosa of the nasopharynx. In this study, we observed an increased absolute count of BAL lymphocytes and increased percentage of CD4 memory cells in BAL at second examination in the 23F cohort. This may reflect a response of the respiratory tract to antigen challenge as it only occurred in the 23F cohort and this cohort also had significant immunoglobulin anti-pneumococcal protein responses following challenge. It is also possible that the altered CD4 profile seen in 5/6 subjects in that cohort resulted from the non-specific activation caused by a previous BAL but this effect was not seen in the 6B cohort. Alternatively, the proportion of memory CD4 T cells in the 23F cohort (pre challenge) is lower than that in the 6B cohort (pre challenge) and therefore the increased recruitment and proportion of memory CD4 T cells may reflect a return to homeostatic levels with concomitant recruitment of antibody secreting plasma cells. There were no increases in antigen-specific CD4 T cell functional assays to suggest specific pneumococcal activation. Current studies in our laboratory aim to characterise the BAL lymphocyte response to experimental human pneumococcal carriage which will provide a more sustained antigen challenge to the lung.\nWe used two different pneumococcal strains and two different protocols in the experimental inoculations of two consecutive cohorts of volunteers. The results in each cohort were similar in that capsular responses were not detected in any compartment and enhanced immunoglobulin responses were not observed in blood. The study design was modified between 23F and 6B cohorts in an attempt to obtain colonisation and is different from that published previously by McCool and Weiser  [25]  likely influencing the results observed. In our study whole cell ELISA data showed significant changes only in the 23F cohort and changes in anti-PspA response were only seen in the 23F cohort when comparing before and after inoculation. This is most likely due to the double dose challenge procedure employed in the 23F cohort compared to the 6B cohort. Two doses are employed to first prime the immune system to vaccine and then second to boost specific responses. This has been performed successfully using rPspA (with alum as adjuvant) in humans leading to 100 fold increases of serum anti-PspA IgG in volunteers immunized with 125 \u00b5g of rPspA  [12] . The rPspA given in this study, however, was intra-muscular and a larger dose. Mucosal sites were not examined for cellular or humoral responses. Differences between the 23F and 6B cohort described here in NW, BAL and serum cannot be ascribed to other confounding variables such as the after effects of BAL collection since this was obtained from both groups and non-specific activation would have to be maintained for at least 10 weeks before being detected in post samples. BAL collection before nasal exposure is a limitation of this study and is an important difference between our 23F challenge model and the model described by McCool and Weiser  [25] . BAL collection may cause systemic  [61]  and local  [62]  side effects but these are usually short term (1-2 days) rather than long term (weeks) effects. We attempted to minimise the pro-inflammatory effect of BAL collection by maintaining a 2 week gap between sample collection and challenge. We cannot rule out the possibility that BAL collection approximately 2 weeks before challenge may have impaired our ability to obtain colonisation following challenge with 23F and 6B compared to the success rate of McCool and Weiser  [25] .\nThe different results obtained from our 23F and 6B cohorts may also be due to different antigenicity of the PspA found in the two inoculated strains; although both strains used for inoculation express similar PspA as that used for ELISA (all clade 1). We are now manufacturing the PspA from each strain in order to improve detection sensitivity but the implication of this pattern of findings is that immunogenicity varies between natural exposures independent of capsular type. In addition, the concentration of specific antibody required for mucosal protection may differ between natural and experimental exposure.\nThese data suggest that a mean dose of  S. pneumoniae  of approximately 8,791 cfu/naris (1 st  dose), and 13,830 cfu/naris (second dose) of 23F or 44,576 cfu/naris of type 6B is sufficient to activate mucosal defence causing a sustained increase in pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA antibody to be detected in mucosal washes 6 weeks after challenge. Pneumococcal colonisation or higher doses of an attenuated strain may be required to elicit T cell and immunoglobulin mediated systemic immunity.\n"], "ner": [[], [], [], [], []], "relations": [[], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], "sentences": ["\nWe anticipated that a low dose of live pneumococci delivered intra-nasally would lead to colonisation and thus augmented mucosal and systemic responses to pneumococci. Colonisation was not achieved in this study but we have shown that human inoculation with a low dose of live pneumococci elicits specific mucosal responses in the absence of carriage. Healthy adult volunteers with detectable humoral and cellular immunity to pneumococci prior to inoculation showed increased immunoglobulin responses in NW and BAL but not blood 6 weeks after experimental bacterial inoculation. In particular, concentrations of IgG measured following inoculation with 23F were increased compared to baseline observations in NW and BAL but not in serum using a whole bacteria ELISA. Concentrations of IgA measured following inoculation with 23F or 6B were increased compared to baseline observations in NW but not in BAL or serum. These responses did not include IgG or IgA to pneumococcal capsule. We measured IgG responses in NW, BAL and serum towards four pneumococcal proteins. We found that IgG anti-PspA was significantly elevated in NW (following 6B challenge) and BAL (following 23F challenge) and accounted in part to the elevated responses seen towards whole pneumococci. Inoculation was associated with an increase in the absolute count and percentage of mucosal memory CD4 T cells for the 23F cohort but not with an increase in paired antigen-specific cellular responses in either group.\nNasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci occurs early in life, frequently in infancy  [5]  and less commonly in adult life  [40] . The most dramatic reduction in carriage and also disease rate occurs in the second year of life  [41]  independent of capsular serotype  [7] . Humoral and cellular responses to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide and protein antigens develop during this time. These immunological developments contribute towards a much lower incidence of pneumococcal mucosal and invasive disease in older children and young adults than in infants  [41] ,  [42] . Repeated episodes of carriage and possibly pneumococcal exposure  [13]  are thought to boost these important defences.\nExperimental human pneumococcal carriage (EHPC) in adults offers the platform to measure these responses  [43] . EHPC in immune adults has been previously reported  [25] ,  [44]  but there has been no previous quantitative report of the mucosal humoral and cellular immune response to challenge not resulting in carriage. Most adult exposures to pneumococcus do not result in carriage and indeed in our experimental pneumococcal inoculations, only one healthy adult progressed to carriage. This result is surprising given that the inoculated dose per naris for both cohorts in our study ( Table 1 ) is similar (23F) or higher (6B) than the CFU dose described by McCool and Weiser  [25]  for their colonised (12,000\u00b15,477/naris) and uncolonised (7,250\u00b14,062/naris) groups. Colonisation success rate will depend on challenge dose but also on the sensitivity of detection, exposure to other non-/infectious agents, presence of co-morbidities, genetic factors, opacity (i.e. capsule expression) of the challenge strain  [45]  and study design.\nThe usefulness of the EHPC model depends on the sensitivity of assays for detection of carriage. Sample collection by nasal swab followed by enrichment for pneumococci using STGG medium and subsequent bacterial culture is the current gold standard method  [46] . A previous EHPC model used throat and nasal swab or wash with standard bacteriological culture media  [25] . We demonstrated that a NW sample is not only more comfortable for the volunteer but better than swabs for detecting upper respiratory flora  [30]  including pneumococcus  [47] . We employed a method combining NW collection and direct plating followed by storage in STGG broth at -80\u00b0C  [30] .", " A molecular approach to pneumococcal identification may yield greater sensitivity compared to culture  [48] ,  [49] , but it does not distinguish between carriage, which implies the presence of viable pneumococci, and retention of bacterial antigen from non-viable cells. A sophisticated molecular approach  [48]  will resolve these issues in the future but we cannot rule out that some volunteers described here were colonised below the detection limit of the current gold standard method. The major strength of this study, however, is that it focused on the immunological impact of a potentially infecting dose of pneumococcus  [25]  on healthy adults with proven previous natural pneumococcal exposure. We have been able to describe responses in the inoculated site (nasopharynx), distal airway and circulating blood.\nThe onset of carriage and acquisition of immunity in infants has been successfully modelled using mice. These models have shown that intra-nasal inoculation using live  [14] ,  [16] ,  [17] ,  [50]  or ethanol killed  [10]  pneumococci or recombinant proteins  [37] ,  [51] - [54]  (some with adjuvant) can elicit humoral and cellular immune responses that protect against subsequent colonisation  [14] ,  [16] - [18]  and/or disease  [16] ,  [17] . Murine models can dissect the relative contribution of humoral and cellular defence  [55]  but are a better model of infancy (naive response) than of adults with pre-existing memory responses. We have shown for the first time that levels of anti-protein IgG and IgA against pneumococus were boosted in both NW and BAL following intranasal challenge with pneumococci, though this depends on the serotype used. The implication of this finding is that exposure to low doses of pneumococcus is potentially immunising at the mucosal surface. A limitation of this study, however, is that the samples collected from the nasopharynx and lung are so dilute that functional measurement of the opsonophagocytic effect of the observed increase in immunoglobulin concentration is not currently possible. Previous studies in several laboratories including ours  [56]  have attempted to concentrate BAL in order to measure opsonic function. Concentration in this way allows binding to be determined but enhanced phagocytosis following immunisation has not been demonstrated.\nIt is interesting that there was no significant change in IgG or IgA to polysaccharide capsule following inoculation. This somewhat counter-intuitive observation is consistent with previous data showing a lack of BAL response to inhaled polysaccharide  [57] . Human experimental colonisation however enhanced serum polysaccharide responses in 5/6 volunteers  [25]  suggesting colonisation has a greater systemic immunising effect compared to challenge. Polysaccharide responses are initiated in the spleen and plasma cells are found in very low numbers in BAL. In the current study we know that bacterial clearance from the nasopharynx was achieved in less than 2 days (probably more rapidly) and it is therefore reasonable to suggest that polysaccharide and bacterial protein were not presented to critical sites or cells to enhance systemic immunity. IgG to polysaccharide capsule is a critical defence mechanism against invasive pneumococcal disease but is less important in defence against carriage  [18] . Our data suggest that experimental pneumococcal exposure without carriage does not augment this limb of systemic defence.\nWe showed altered mucosal responses to protein antigens, particularly choline bound proteins such as PspA. Using Western blot and whole cell ELISA, more IgG to pneumococcal protein was found after inoculation than before in both NW and BAL in the 23F cohort. The Western blots show a greater effect of inoculation on the choline binding proteins than on proteins extracted without choline chloride.", " Specific anti-protein ELISA was only able to detect a statistically significant difference in one of the 4 proteins tested (PspA) although NW IgG levels to the other three were all increased in the 6B challenged cohort. There are many pneumococcal surface-proteins that function as virulence factors and are sufficiently surface exposed to have vaccine potential. Some of these pneumococcal surface proteins, including PspA, PspC and PsaA, have been shown to have roles in adhesion and carriage and may vary in expression between pneumococcal isolates. Human anti-PspA responses elicited by intra-muscular vaccination with rPspA are protective against subsequent lethal challenge with heterologous pneumococci when passively transferred in murine models  [12]  and therefore the response seen in our 6B (NW) and 23F (BAL) cohort may be of functional significance. Both strains used in our study express PspA clade 1 similar to the PspA used for the ELISA. The absence of a NW response in the 23F cohort could be due to low PspA expression by the inoculated strain or adsorption of nasal antibodies to the inoculated bacteria. The concentration of IgG to PspA in mucosal samples is so diluted that direct functional assays or passive transfer experiments are unlikely to succeed. Alternatively, increased protection due to immunoglobulin responses in NW could be tested by repeated pneumococcal challenge of subjects with heterologous or homologous serotypes who develop experimental carriage and/or enhanced immunoglobulin responses on the first inoculation. This study is planned in our laboratory.\nMurine models have demonstrated that pneumococcal colonisation or vaccination results in the generation of memory CD4 T and B cells in both the circulation and at the mucosa. The effector CD4 T cell phenotype is mixed but includes IL-17  [14] ,  [37] ,  [58]  and/or IFNgamma  [37] ,  [51]  secreting T cells (T h-17 /T h-1 ). NW samples from healthy adults had very low cell counts in this study which is not surprising given that mucosal immune cells are found in specialised sub-mucosal lymphoid aggregates, best investigated in humans by using surgical explants  [59] . We were, however, able to demonstrate antigen-specific T cells producing cytokine in response to specific stimuli in BAL both before and after nasal inoculation. Pneumococcal challenge, however, did not alter the frequency of pneumococcal specific, cytokine secreting, CD4 T cells in BAL. The dose of pneumococci delivered to the lung in our non-colonised subjects is likely to have been very small and therefore the antigenic stimulus to lung during the inoculation period in our subjects will have been minimal. The lymphatic drainage of the nasopharynx is to the cervical lymph nodes whilst the lungs drain to the hilar nodes; we would therefore expect that antigen challenge of the nasopharynx would have limited impact on BAL lymphocytes. A recent murine model, however, has shown that viral upper respiratory tract infections lead to the migration of clonally-related populations of activated T cells to both upper  and  lower respiratory mucosal sites  [60] . These data suggests that measuring the proportion and phenotype of antigen specific T cells in the BAL mucosal compartment in humans may be similar to the proportion and phenotype of effector T cell populations present in the sub-mucosa of the nasopharynx. In this study, we observed an increased absolute count of BAL lymphocytes and increased percentage of CD4 memory cells in BAL at second examination in the 23F cohort. This may reflect a response of the respiratory tract to antigen challenge as it only occurred in the 23F cohort and this cohort also had significant immunoglobulin anti-pneumococcal protein responses following challenge. It is also possible that the altered CD4 profile seen in 5/6 subjects in that cohort resulted from the non-specific activation caused by a previous BAL but this effect was not seen in the 6B cohort.", " Alternatively, the proportion of memory CD4 T cells in the 23F cohort (pre challenge) is lower than that in the 6B cohort (pre challenge) and therefore the increased recruitment and proportion of memory CD4 T cells may reflect a return to homeostatic levels with concomitant recruitment of antibody secreting plasma cells. There were no increases in antigen-specific CD4 T cell functional assays to suggest specific pneumococcal activation. Current studies in our laboratory aim to characterise the BAL lymphocyte response to experimental human pneumococcal carriage which will provide a more sustained antigen challenge to the lung.\nWe used two different pneumococcal strains and two different protocols in the experimental inoculations of two consecutive cohorts of volunteers. The results in each cohort were similar in that capsular responses were not detected in any compartment and enhanced immunoglobulin responses were not observed in blood. The study design was modified between 23F and 6B cohorts in an attempt to obtain colonisation and is different from that published previously by McCool and Weiser  [25]  likely influencing the results observed. In our study whole cell ELISA data showed significant changes only in the 23F cohort and changes in anti-PspA response were only seen in the 23F cohort when comparing before and after inoculation. This is most likely due to the double dose challenge procedure employed in the 23F cohort compared to the 6B cohort. Two doses are employed to first prime the immune system to vaccine and then second to boost specific responses. This has been performed successfully using rPspA (with alum as adjuvant) in humans leading to 100 fold increases of serum anti-PspA IgG in volunteers immunized with 125 \u00b5g of rPspA  [12] . The rPspA given in this study, however, was intra-muscular and a larger dose. Mucosal sites were not examined for cellular or humoral responses. Differences between the 23F and 6B cohort described here in NW, BAL and serum cannot be ascribed to other confounding variables such as the after effects of BAL collection since this was obtained from both groups and non-specific activation would have to be maintained for at least 10 weeks before being detected in post samples. BAL collection before nasal exposure is a limitation of this study and is an important difference between our 23F challenge model and the model described by McCool and Weiser  [25] . BAL collection may cause systemic  [61]  and local  [62]  side effects but these are usually short term (1-2 days) rather than long term (weeks) effects. We attempted to minimise the pro-inflammatory effect of BAL collection by maintaining a 2 week gap between sample collection and challenge. We cannot rule out the possibility that BAL collection approximately 2 weeks before challenge may have impaired our ability to obtain colonisation following challenge with 23F and 6B compared to the success rate of McCool and Weiser  [25] .\nThe different results obtained from our 23F and 6B cohorts may also be due to different antigenicity of the PspA found in the two inoculated strains; although both strains used for inoculation express similar PspA as that used for ELISA (all clade 1). We are now manufacturing the PspA from each strain in order to improve detection sensitivity but the implication of this pattern of findings is that immunogenicity varies between natural exposures independent of capsular type.

{"doc_key": "3320601_Results", "text": ["\nRecruitment and human pneumococcal challenge\nTwenty volunteers were recruited and inoculated per protocol as shown in  Figure 1  with no adverse effects. One subject in the 23F cohort established experimental colonisation as a result of the inoculation and is excluded from further description in this study. In the first cohort 8 subjects received two doses of 23F mean dose 8,791 cfu/naris (SD\u00b11,935 cfu/naris) and 13,830 cfu/naris (SD\u00b14,504 cfu/naris), given 2 weeks apart ( Figure 1 A  and  Table 1 ). In our second cohort we challenged 11 volunteers with a single, mean dose of 44,576 6B cfu/naris (SD\u00b112,815 cfu/naris) ( Figure 1 B  and  Table 1 ). These remaining nineteen study volunteers did not establish colonisation following pneumococcal challenge, contrary to our initial expectations. We did not detect pneumococci in any nasal washes obtained from these nineteen volunteers. Details of the study participants who were challenged with pneumococci are given in  Table 1  for both 23F and 6B cohorts.\nNasal wash volumes recovered were a mean of 5.9 ml (range 2.3 to 8.5 ml) for the 23F cohort and 6.5 ml for the 6B cohort (range 4 to 8.1 ml). BAL volumes with cell counts are shown in  Table S1 .\nIntra-nasal pneumococcal challenge increases mucosal pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA\nPneumococcal whole cell ELISA data were compared before and after pneumococcal challenge in 3 compartments (NW, BAL and serum) using samples from the first 7 volunteers for the 23F cohort and 8 volunteers in the 6B cohort as shown in  Figure 2 . Three volunteers were excluded from the 6B cohort as a full set of paired samples were not obtained. In each cohort, the relevant challenge pneumococcal strain was used as the ELISA target antigen. Whole cell ELISA using 23F and 6B pneumococcus detected antigen-specific IgG and IgA in all NW, BAL and serum samples both before and after inoculating challenge. Antigen-specific titers of pneumococcal specific IgG were much higher in serum than in NW (200-fold) or BAL (1000-fold). Similarly, serum levels of pneumococcal specific IgA were much higher than in NW (10-fold for 6B and 100-fold for 23F) and BAL (100-fold for 6B and 1000-fold for 23F). There was no association between volume of fluid returned and immunoglobulin titer for either NW or BAL samples.\nComparisons before and after nasal inoculation with bacteria showed that there was no change in pneumococcus-specific IgG or IgA in serum following inoculation with either 23F or 6B as shown in  Figures 2A and 2B . There was a significant increase in both IgG (pre 25.4\u00b17.5 vs post 52.5\u00b17.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) and IgA titers (pre 47.5\u00b117.9 vs post 122\u00b157.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) in NW following 23F inoculation, and a significant increase in IgA in NW following 6B inoculation (pre 36\u00b114.4 vs post 58\u00b115.9, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) as shown in  Figures 2C and 2D . BAL data showed a significant increase in anti-pneumococcal IgG titer following 23F (pre 6\u00b12.5 vs post 16.2\u00b18.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) but not 6B challenge ( Figure 2E ). Anti-pneumococcal IgA responses in BAL before and after 23F or 6B challenge were unaltered ( Figure 2F ). In summary, intranasal inoculation of bacteria was associated with increased NW (IgG and IgA) and BAL (IgG only) immunoglobulin responses but no change in serum levels. These observations were dependent on whether the challenge was with 23F (NW and BAL) or 6B (NW IgA only) pneumococcal serotype.\nIncreased pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA responses are directed towards pneumococcal proteins and not capsular polysaccharide\nWe next determined which pneumococcal antigenic targets were responsible for the increased antibody responses. We measured anti-23F or 6B capsular polysaccharide responses before and after challenge with the respective challenge strain in NW, BAL and serum. There were no significant differences in 23F or 6B anti-capsular polysaccharide responses before and after challenge in either cohort ( Figure S1  A-C).\nWe followed up our observations in  Figure 2 , showing a significant difference in IgG titer before and after 23F but not 6B challenge, by performing Western blots to compare IgG responses to 23F pneumococcal proteins on the same NW sample set.  Figure 3  shows results from NW taken from 8 subjects before ( Figure 3  Pre) and after ( Figure 3  Post) nasal challenge with 23F. There was more antigenic protein in each gel following CCE compared to WCE. The dominant protein antigen seen in all NW samples before challenge was a CCE band migrating to 110-150 kDa. Following challenge with 23F ( Figure 3  Post) there was a general increase in the overall level of NW antibody binding in both WCE and CCE lanes in all NW samples. There was particularly increased reactivity towards the 110-150 kDa band in all but one subjects and a new band slightly above 60 kDa in 5/8 donors ( Figure 3  Post). These data indicate an increase in IgG response towards pneumococcal proteins following 23F exposure.\nPneumococcal protein specific IgG is increased in NW following 6B but not 23F challenge\nWe next used purified proteins in an ELISA to quantitatively determine the specific pneumococcal proteins which elicited increased total pneumococcal specific IgG responses in NW following bacterial challenge. We measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG ( Figure 4 ) levels in both 23F and 6B pneumococcal challenge cohorts before and after challenge. In the 23F challenge cohort we did not detect any difference in the concentration of anti-PspA ( Figure 4A ), PspC ( Figure 4B ), PdB ( Figure 4C ) or PsaA ( Figure 4D ) IgG before and after challenge. In the 6B challenge cohort, we detected a significant rise in the mean concentration of anti-PspA (pre 49.2\u00b112.7 vs post 301.5\u00b1196.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) ( Figure 4A ). The mean concentration of anti-PspC (pre 28.2\u00b17.3 vs post 93.8\u00b155.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.07) ( Figure 4B ), anti-PdB (pre 2.3\u00b10.8 vs post 21.4\u00b115.12, p\u200a=\u200a0.06) ( Figure 4C ) and anti-PsaA ( Figure 4D ) (pre 2.8\u00b11.2 vs post 22.5\u00b116.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.1) antibody were all higher post 6B challenge compared to pre-challenge samples but these differences were not statistically significant. The Western blot and these ELISA data suggest that the antibody response to whole pneumococci extends beyond these 4 studied antigenic proteins.\nIntra-nasal 23F pneumococcal challenge increases anti-PspA IgG in BAL\nBacterial challenge with type 23F pneumococcus was associated with increased BAL IgG titer in pneumococcal whole cell ELISA but not with increased anti-capsular BAL IgG. We therefore measured anti-pneumococcal protein IgG levels in BAL samples following 23F challenge. We measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG responses in BAL ( Figure 5 ) for both challenge cohorts. There was a significant increase in the concentration of anti-PspA specific IgG in BAL following challenge with 23F (pre 96.4\u00b132.2 vs post 161.7\u00b157, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) but not 6B ( Figure 5A ). A higher concentration of anti-PspC IgG in BAL following challenge with 23F (pre 37.9\u00b110.7 vs post 90.2\u00b132.3, p\u200a=\u200a0.07) was observed ( Figure 5B ) but was not statistically significant. There were no differences in the concentration of anti-PdB ( Figure 5C ) and PsaA ( Figure 5D ) IgG in BAL before and after challenge with 23F. There were no differences in protein specific responses in BAL before and after 6B challenge ( Figure 5A-D ).\nPneumococcal 23F challenge decreases serum anti-PspA\nAlthough there were no changes in serum observed following bacterial challenge using either whole cell ELISA or capsular polysaccharide ELISA, we measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG in serum before and after challenge with 23F or 6B ( Figure 6 ). In contrast to the increased anti-PspA measured in BAL following 23F challenge there was a significant  decrease  in the concentration of serum anti-PspA following challenge with 23F (serum pre 125.6\u00b142 vs serum post 76.9\u00b114, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) but not 6B ( Figure 6A ). The concentration of anti-PspC ( Figure 6B ), PdB ( Figure 6C ) and PsaA ( Figure 6D ) were similar before and after challenge for both 23F and 6B cohorts.\nPneumococcal challenge shows evidence of mild inflammation\nWe next compared the cellularity and cellular responses in NW samples obtained from subjects before and after pneumococcal challenge from both 23F (first dose only) and 6B cohorts.\nNW sample cellularity was low and variable (range 0-9300 total cells) in samples collected. There was no difference in total cell yield before and after challenge for the 23F cohort ( Figure S2 ). Increased levels of cellular effectors (neutrophils and mononuclear cells) and/or granular mucus deposits (evidence of inflammation) compared to baseline were seen on cytospins of NW preparations in 4/8 volunteers 2 days after 23F challenge and in 2/8 volunteers at 4 days. IL-17 ELISA (eBioscience, UK, Catalogue 88-7176-22) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on NW samples from 4 volunteers showed no detectable cytokine before and after 23F challenge. In the 6B cohort 5/7 samples showed increased cellular effectors and/or granular mucus deposits in samples taken immediately after 6B challenge compared with before challenge.\nPneumococcal challenge is associated with altered mucosal T cell memory in BAL but no increase in antigen-specific T cell responses before and after challenge\nThere were no differences in BAL volume and total cell yield before and after 23F or 6B challenge ( Table S1 ). In the cohort challenged with 23F, there was a significantly higher total lymphocyte count (mean\u00b1SD Pre 1.9\u00b10.75\u00d710 6  vs post 3.2\u00b11.2\u00d710 6  p\u200a=\u200a0.006) after challenge compared to before in BAL. The percentage of total T cells that were of the memory CD4 phenotype was also significantly higher after challenge compared to before (mean%\u00b1SD, Pre 40.05\u00b120.6 vs post 48.47\u00b114.7, p\u200a=\u200a0.048). Total BAL lymphocyte counts showed correlation with the BAL anti-23F whole cell antibody titre (p\u200a=\u200a0.01, Pearson correlation) and anti-PspA concentration (p\u200a=\u200a0.03, Pearson correlation) for the 23F but not the 6B cohort ( Figure S3 ). In the cohort challenged with 6B, there was no increase in total lymphocyte count, no increase in % memory CD4 T cells and no association of lymphocyte numbers with anti-pneumococcal IgG by whole cell ELISA ( Figure S3 ).\nThe data for antigen-specific T cell responses (baseline corrected) are shown in  Figure 7  as the percentage of memory CD4 T cells producing at least one cytokine (of IFN-gamma, TNF or IL-17) before and after the subject was intra-nasally inoculated with pneumococci.\nAntigen-specific responses, to influenza and pneumococcal preparations, compared to non-stimulated cells, were seen to a varying degree in blood and BAL from both cohorts  before  challenge. In the 23F cohort, significant antigen-specific responses (compared with non-stimulated control) were seen to influenza in BAL (mean%\u00b1SD, 0.85\u00b10.66 vs non-stimulated 0.42\u00b10.36 p\u200a=\u200a0.03,  n \u200a=\u200a7) and blood (0.15\u00b10.05 vs control 0.05\u00b10.07, p\u200a=\u200a0.03,  n \u200a=\u200a8). There were no significant responses to pneumococcal antigens before inoculation in blood or BAL but there were significant responses to 23 c/s  after  inoculation in BAL (0.55\u00b10.28 vs vehicle 0.35\u00b10.16, p\u200a=\u200a0.032,  n \u200a=\u200a8).\nIn the 6B cohort, significant antigen-specific responses (compared to non-stimulated control) were seen to influenza in BAL (0.5\u00b10.29 vs non-stimulated 0.19\u00b10.09, p\u200a=\u200a0.02) but not blood. We also detected significant responses to 6B whole pneumococci but not 6B culture supernatant in BAL (0.40\u00b10.26 vs control 0.18\u00b10.09 p\u200a=\u200a0.05) before pneumococcal challenge.

One subject in the 23F cohort established experimental colonisation as a result of the inoculation and is excluded from further description in this study. In the first cohort 8 subjects received two doses of 23F mean dose 8,791 cfu/naris (SD\u00b11,935 cfu/naris) and 13,830 cfu/naris (SD\u00b14,504 cfu/naris), given 2 weeks apart ( Figure 1 A  and  Table 1 ). In our second cohort we challenged 11 volunteers with a single, mean dose of 44,576 6B cfu/naris (SD\u00b112,815 cfu/naris) ( Figure 1 B  and  Table 1 ). These remaining nineteen study volunteers did not establish colonisation following pneumococcal challenge, contrary to our initial expectations. We did not detect pneumococci in any nasal washes obtained from these nineteen volunteers. Details of the study participants who were challenged with pneumococci are given in  Table 1  for both 23F and 6B cohorts.\nNasal wash volumes recovered were a mean of 5.9 ml (range 2.3 to 8.5 ml) for the 23F cohort and 6.5 ml for the 6B cohort (range 4 to 8.1 ml). BAL volumes with cell counts are shown in  Table S1 .\nIntra-nasal pneumococcal challenge increases mucosal pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA\nPneumococcal whole cell ELISA data were compared before and after pneumococcal challenge in 3 compartments (NW, BAL and serum) using samples from the first 7 volunteers for the 23F cohort and 8 volunteers in the 6B cohort as shown in  Figure 2 . Three volunteers were excluded from the 6B cohort as a full set of paired samples were not obtained. In each cohort, the relevant challenge pneumococcal strain was used as the ELISA target antigen. Whole cell ELISA using 23F and 6B pneumococcus detected antigen-specific IgG and IgA in all NW, BAL and serum samples both before and after inoculating challenge. Antigen-specific titers of pneumococcal specific IgG were much higher in serum than in NW (200-fold) or BAL (1000-fold). Similarly, serum levels of pneumococcal specific IgA were much higher than in NW (10-fold for 6B and 100-fold for 23F) and BAL (100-fold for 6B and 1000-fold for 23F). There was no association between volume of fluid returned and immunoglobulin titer for either NW or BAL samples.\nComparisons before and after nasal inoculation with bacteria showed that there was no change in pneumococcus-specific IgG or IgA in serum following inoculation with either 23F or 6B as shown in  Figures 2A and 2B . There was a significant increase in both IgG (pre 25.4\u00b17.5 vs post 52.5\u00b17.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) and IgA titers (pre 47.5\u00b117.9 vs post 122\u00b157.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) in NW following 23F inoculation, and a significant increase in IgA in NW following 6B inoculation (pre 36\u00b114.4 vs post 58\u00b115.9, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) as shown in  Figures 2C and 2D . BAL data showed a significant increase in anti-pneumococcal IgG titer following 23F (pre 6\u00b12.5 vs post 16.2\u00b18.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) but not 6B challenge ( Figure 2E ). Anti-pneumococcal IgA responses in BAL before and after 23F or 6B challenge were unaltered ( Figure 2F ). In summary, intranasal inoculation of bacteria was associated with increased NW (IgG and IgA) and BAL (IgG only) immunoglobulin responses but no change in serum levels. These observations were dependent on whether the challenge was with 23F (NW and BAL) or 6B (NW IgA only) pneumococcal serotype.\nIncreased pneumococcal specific IgG and IgA responses are directed towards pneumococcal proteins and not capsular polysaccharide\nWe next determined which pneumococcal antigenic targets were responsible for the increased antibody responses. We measured anti-23F or 6B capsular polysaccharide responses before and after challenge with the respective challenge strain in NW, BAL and serum. There were no significant differences in 23F or 6B anti-capsular polysaccharide responses before and after challenge in either cohort ( Figure S1  A-C).", "\nWe followed up our observations in  Figure 2 , showing a significant difference in IgG titer before and after 23F but not 6B challenge, by performing Western blots to compare IgG responses to 23F pneumococcal proteins on the same NW sample set.  Figure 3  shows results from NW taken from 8 subjects before ( Figure 3  Pre) and after ( Figure 3  Post) nasal challenge with 23F. There was more antigenic protein in each gel following CCE compared to WCE. The dominant protein antigen seen in all NW samples before challenge was a CCE band migrating to 110-150 kDa. Following challenge with 23F ( Figure 3  Post) there was a general increase in the overall level of NW antibody binding in both WCE and CCE lanes in all NW samples. There was particularly increased reactivity towards the 110-150 kDa band in all but one subjects and a new band slightly above 60 kDa in 5/8 donors ( Figure 3  Post). These data indicate an increase in IgG response towards pneumococcal proteins following 23F exposure.\nPneumococcal protein specific IgG is increased in NW following 6B but not 23F challenge\nWe next used purified proteins in an ELISA to quantitatively determine the specific pneumococcal proteins which elicited increased total pneumococcal specific IgG responses in NW following bacterial challenge. We measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG ( Figure 4 ) levels in both 23F and 6B pneumococcal challenge cohorts before and after challenge. In the 23F challenge cohort we did not detect any difference in the concentration of anti-PspA ( Figure 4A ), PspC ( Figure 4B ), PdB ( Figure 4C ) or PsaA ( Figure 4D ) IgG before and after challenge. In the 6B challenge cohort, we detected a significant rise in the mean concentration of anti-PspA (pre 49.2\u00b112.7 vs post 301.5\u00b1196.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) ( Figure 4A ). The mean concentration of anti-PspC (pre 28.2\u00b17.3 vs post 93.8\u00b155.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.07) ( Figure 4B ), anti-PdB (pre 2.3\u00b10.8 vs post 21.4\u00b115.12, p\u200a=\u200a0.06) ( Figure 4C ) and anti-PsaA ( Figure 4D ) (pre 2.8\u00b11.2 vs post 22.5\u00b116.6, p\u200a=\u200a0.1) antibody were all higher post 6B challenge compared to pre-challenge samples but these differences were not statistically significant. The Western blot and these ELISA data suggest that the antibody response to whole pneumococci extends beyond these 4 studied antigenic proteins.\nIntra-nasal 23F pneumococcal challenge increases anti-PspA IgG in BAL\nBacterial challenge with type 23F pneumococcus was associated with increased BAL IgG titer in pneumococcal whole cell ELISA but not with increased anti-capsular BAL IgG. We therefore measured anti-pneumococcal protein IgG levels in BAL samples following 23F challenge. We measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG responses in BAL ( Figure 5 ) for both challenge cohorts. There was a significant increase in the concentration of anti-PspA specific IgG in BAL following challenge with 23F (pre 96.4\u00b132.2 vs post 161.7\u00b157, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) but not 6B ( Figure 5A ). A higher concentration of anti-PspC IgG in BAL following challenge with 23F (pre 37.9\u00b110.7 vs post 90.2\u00b132.3, p\u200a=\u200a0.07) was observed ( Figure 5B ) but was not statistically significant. There were no differences in the concentration of anti-PdB ( Figure 5C ) and PsaA ( Figure 5D ) IgG in BAL before and after challenge with 23F. There were no differences in protein specific responses in BAL before and after 6B challenge ( Figure 5A-D ).\nPneumococcal 23F challenge decreases serum anti-PspA\nAlthough there were no changes in serum observed following bacterial challenge using either whole cell ELISA or capsular polysaccharide ELISA, we measured anti-PspA, PspC, PdB and PsaA IgG in serum before and after challenge with 23F or 6B ( Figure 6 ). In contrast to the increased anti-PspA measured in BAL following 23F challenge there was a significant  decrease  in the concentration of serum anti-PspA following challenge with 23F (serum pre 125.6\u00b142 vs serum post 76.9\u00b114, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) but not 6B ( Figure 6A ).", " The concentration of anti-PspC ( Figure 6B ), PdB ( Figure 6C ) and PsaA ( Figure 6D ) were similar before and after challenge for both 23F and 6B cohorts.\nPneumococcal challenge shows evidence of mild inflammation\nWe next compared the cellularity and cellular responses in NW samples obtained from subjects before and after pneumococcal challenge from both 23F (first dose only) and 6B cohorts.\nNW sample cellularity was low and variable (range 0-9300 total cells) in samples collected. There was no difference in total cell yield before and after challenge for the 23F cohort ( Figure S2 ). Increased levels of cellular effectors (neutrophils and mononuclear cells) and/or granular mucus deposits (evidence of inflammation) compared to baseline were seen on cytospins of NW preparations in 4/8 volunteers 2 days after 23F challenge and in 2/8 volunteers at 4 days. IL-17 ELISA (eBioscience, UK, Catalogue 88-7176-22) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions on NW samples from 4 volunteers showed no detectable cytokine before and after 23F challenge. In the 6B cohort 5/7 samples showed increased cellular effectors and/or granular mucus deposits in samples taken immediately after 6B challenge compared with before challenge.\nPneumococcal challenge is associated with altered mucosal T cell memory in BAL but no increase in antigen-specific T cell responses before and after challenge\nThere were no differences in BAL volume and total cell yield before and after 23F or 6B challenge ( Table S1 ). In the cohort challenged with 23F, there was a significantly higher total lymphocyte count (mean\u00b1SD Pre 1.9\u00b10.75\u00d710 6  vs post 3.2\u00b11.2\u00d710 6  p\u200a=\u200a0.006) after challenge compared to before in BAL. The percentage of total T cells that were of the memory CD4 phenotype was also significantly higher after challenge compared to before (mean%\u00b1SD, Pre 40.05\u00b120.6 vs post 48.47\u00b114.7, p\u200a=\u200a0.048). Total BAL lymphocyte counts showed correlation with the BAL anti-23F whole cell antibody titre (p\u200a=\u200a0.01, Pearson correlation) and anti-PspA concentration (p\u200a=\u200a0.03, Pearson correlation) for the 23F but not the 6B cohort ( Figure S3 ). In the cohort challenged with 6B, there was no increase in total lymphocyte count, no increase in % memory CD4 T cells and no association of lymphocyte numbers with anti-pneumococcal IgG by whole cell ELISA ( Figure S3 ).\nThe data for antigen-specific T cell responses (baseline corrected) are shown in  Figure 7  as the percentage of memory CD4 T cells producing at least one cytokine (of IFN-gamma, TNF or IL-17) before and after the subject was intra-nasally inoculated with pneumococci.\nAntigen-specific responses, to influenza and pneumococcal preparations, compared to non-stimulated cells, were seen to a varying degree in blood and BAL from both cohorts  before  challenge. In the 23F cohort, significant antigen-specific responses (compared with non-stimulated control) were seen to influenza in BAL (mean%\u00b1SD, 0.85\u00b10.66 vs non-stimulated 0.42\u00b10.36 p\u200a=\u200a0.03,  n \u200a=\u200a7) and blood (0.15\u00b10.05 vs control 0.05\u00b10.07, p\u200a=\u200a0.03,  n \u200a=\u200a8). There were no significant responses to pneumococcal antigens before inoculation in blood or BAL but there were significant responses to 23 c/s  after  inoculation in BAL (0.55\u00b10.28 vs vehicle 0.35\u00b10.16, p\u200a=\u200a0.032,  n \u200a=\u200a8).\nIn the 6B cohort, significant antigen-specific responses (compared to non-stimulated control) were seen to influenza in BAL (0.5\u00b10.29 vs non-stimulated 0.19\u00b10.09, p\u200a=\u200a0.02) but not blood.

Persistent antigenic exposure from pneumococcal colonisation can induce both humoral and cellular defences that are protective against carriage and disease. We challenged healthy adults intra-nasally with live 23F or 6B  Streptococcus pneumoniae  in two sequential cohorts and collected nasal wash, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood before and 6 weeks after challenge. We hypothesised that both cohorts would successfully become colonised but this did not occur except for one volunteer. The effect of bacterial challenge without colonisation in healthy adults has not been previously assessed. We measured the antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in challenged but not colonised volunteers by ELISA and Flow Cytometry. Antigen-specific responses were seen in each compartment both before and after bacterial challenge for both cohorts. Antigen-specific IgG and IgA levels were significantly elevated in nasal wash 6 weeks after challenge compared to baseline. Immunoglobulin responses to pneumococci were directed towards various protein targets but not capsular polysaccharide. 23F but not 6B challenge elevated IgG anti-PspA in BAL. Serum immunoglobulins did not increase in response to challenge. In neither challenge cohort was there any alteration in the frequencies of TNF, IL-17 or IFNgamma producing CD4 T cells before or after challenge in BAL or blood. We show that simple, low dose mucosal exposure with pneumococci may immunise mucosal surfaces by augmenting anti-protein immunoglobulin responses; but not capsular or cellular responses. We hypothesise that mucosal exposure alone may not replicate the systemic immunising effect of experimental or natural carriage in humans.\nExposure to respiratory pathogens such as  Streptococcus pneumoniae  (pneumococcus) is a frequent event that can result in immediate clearance, nasal colonisation or disease for the host. Human and mouse studies have shown that natural colonisation is an immunising event. Colonisation is prevalent in children but rare in human adults (<10%), suggesting that despite high pneumococcal exposure adult mucosal defences are sufficient to prevent colonisation.

We recruited non-smoking adults aged between 18 and 60 years with no history or signs of systemic or respiratory disease. Individuals who were already naturally colonised with pneumococcus or had regular contact with at risk individuals, such as young children, were excluded from the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee, Sefton, Liverpool (08/H1001/52) and the study was sponsored by the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust.\nStudy design\nSamples of blood, serum, nasal wash (NW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were obtained before and after bacterial challenge according to two different sampling protocols ( Figure 1 ). Volunteers in our first study were intra-nasally challenged with two doses of 23F ( Figure 1A ) and in the second study a single dose of 6B ( Figure 1B )  S. pneumoniae  was used. In the 23F challenge cohort NW samples were collected 2 weeks and 1 week before inoculation and on days 2, 4, and 7 after each inoculation. In the 6B challenge cohort ( Figure 1B ) NWs were collected 2 weeks before challenge and 2 and 7 days following inoculation. NWs were then collected once per week for 5 consecutive weeks. A final set of post-challenge samples (blood, serum, NW and BAL) were then collected at 6 weeks.\n23F and 6B preparation and volunteer inoculation\nClinical isolates of  S. pneumoniae  serotype 23F (P833 a gift of Prof. JN Weiser, University of Pennsylvania) and 6B (BHN418 a gift of Prof. P Hermans, University of Nijmegen) were used for inoculation. Bacterial stocks were grown to mid-log phase in Vegitone broth (Oxoid)  [29]  in order to avoid volunteer exposure to animal products and stored in 1 ml aliquots of Vegitone with 10% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich) at -80\u00b0C. Serotype confirmation was performed using latex agglutination (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen) and was confirmed by an independent reference laboratory (Health Protection Agency, Colindale, UK).\nOn each day of inoculation two aliquots were thawed, centrifuged and bacterial pellets were washed once before being re-suspended and diluted in sterile 0.9% saline to reach the desired concentration of bacteria. For the 23F cohort 9,000 CFU/naris in 100 \u00b5l saline were used for the first inoculation. If colonisation was not established following this inoculation we performed a second inoculation with 20,000 CFU/naris in 100 \u00b5l saline. For the 6B cohort 40,000CFU/100 \u00b5l/naris was administered. Volunteers tilted their head slightly back and 100 \u00b5l of bacterial suspension was dropped onto each naris using a P200 pipette taking care not to touch the mucosa. Serial dilutions of the original inocula were plated onto blood agar for dose confirmation ( Table 1 ).\n\n           10.1371/journal.ppat.1002622.t001 \n           Table 1 \n           23F and 6B cohort study details. \n           \n             \n           \n             \n                 \n                 \n               \n                 \n               \n                   23F \n                   6B \n                 \n                   \n               \n                 \n               Total number of volunteers \n                   8 \n                   11 \n                 \n                   \n                 Gender (M\u2236F) \n                   4\u22364 \n                   4\u22367 \n                 \n                   \n                 Age (mean\u00b1SD) \n                   31\u00b116 \n                   25\u00b16 \n                 \n                   \n                 st  challenge dose (per naris) (mean\u00b1SD) 1 \n                   8,791\u00b11,935 \n                   44,576\u00b112,815 \n                 \n                   \n                 nd  challenge dose (per naris) (mean\u00b1SD) 2 \n                   13,830\u00b14,504 \n                   n/a \n                 \n                   \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n        \nNasal washing and determination of carriage\nNW samples were collected before and after challenge and processed as previously described  [30] . Briefly, a single aliquot of 5 ml normal saline was instilled into each naris with the subject seated leaning back supported at 45\u00b0 to the horizontal. At instillation, the subject was invited to hold their breath and push gently on the back of the upper teeth with their tongue. Saline was held in the nasopharynx for 5 seconds and then poured out by gently tipping the head forward while holding a Petri dish under the nose. The samples collected from each naris were pooled. This process was performed once for the 6B cohort but 3 times for the 23F cohort. Samples were transferred immediately to the laboratory for processing. The first pooled aliquot obtained from each NW visit in both cohorts was used to determine carriage status (all negative except for one volunteer) and pneumococcal specific immunoglobulin analysis. NW samples were spun at 3345 g for 10 minutes and the supernatant stored at -80\u00b0C. The pellet was re-suspended in 100 \u00b5l of skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol (STGG) preservative medium prior to plating. 25 \u00b5l was plated onto Columbia Horse Blood Agar (Oxoid) with gentamicin (Sigma) and the remainder diluted to 1 ml with STGG and plated (50 \u00b5l) on blood and chocolate agar (Oxoid) for determination of co-colonising flora. Remaining STGG samples were stored at -80\u00b0 for long term storage  [31]  and confirmation if needed. Plates were inspected after 24 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2  and alpha haemolytic, draughtsman-like colonies were sub-cultured to determine pneumococcal phenotype. Optochin sensitivity, bile solubility and latex agglutination testing were performed to confirm pneumococcal phenotype. Subjects in whom pneumococci were not detected from NW samples collected on at least 2 consecutive visits were defined as non-colonised. Colonised subjects are defined as subjects in whom pneumococci was recovered from any nasal wash.\nThe numbers of lymphocytes in NW were too few for analysis of cognate antigen specific T cell responses using flow cytometry. We measured the NW total cell count and also examined stained cytospin slides for increased numbers of cellular effectors and mucus deposits. Total cell counts in NW were determined from pooled aliquots 2 and 3 from the 23F cohort. Cells were pelleted at 400 g and resuspended in PBS. Cell counts were performed using 10 \u00b5l of cell suspension and a haemocytometer, with the final count given per ml of NW fluid returned. The remainder was pelleted as above and re-suspended in 50 \u00b5l of PBS and centrifuged onto a microscope slide using a cytocentrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 5 mins at 450 rpm. For the 6B cohort a representative sample of 10 \u00b5l was taken from STGG preparations (described above). These samples were made up to 50 \u00b5l with PBS and cytospins were prepared as described. Microscope slides were allowed to air dry before staining with Hemacolor rapid staining set (Merck, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An arbitrary semi-quantitative scoring system was used to assign whether an increase, decrease or no change had occurred.\nBlood processing\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from volunteer samples using Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBMCs were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2  at a concentration of 5\u00d710 5  cells per ml/well in a 48-well plate in RPMI 1640 media with 2 mM L-glutamine (both Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% human AB serum (Invitrogen, UK). Cells were stimulated on the same day as collection.\nSerum was obtained from clotted whole blood collected into serum monovettes (Sarstedt, UK). Samples were centrifuged at 2560 g for 7 minutes. Serum was taken and stored at -80\u00b0C for immunoglobulin analysis.\nBAL processing\nBronchoscopy was performed using topical local anaesthesia with minimal sedation and BAL collected as described previously  [32] . Briefly, four aliquots, totalling 200 mls, of warm 0.9% saline was instilled and gently retrieved from a sub-segmental bronchus of the right middle lobe by gentle hand suction and the BAL placed into sterile pots on ice. BAL was processed as previously described  [33] . Briefly, whole BAL was filtered through muslin to remove mucus and 3 ml of unprocessed BAL was stored at -80\u00b0C. The whole sample was centrifuged at 470 g for 10 minutes. BAL supernatant was stored at -80\u00b0C for immunoglobulin analysis. BAL cells were re-suspended in RPMI 1640 media as described for PBMCs with the addition of antibiotics (penicillin 40 U/ml, streptomycin 40 \u00b5g/ml, neomycin 80 \u00b5g/ml (all P4083, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 \u00b5g/ml of amphotericin B (A2942, Sigma-Aldrich). Total BAL macrophages and lymphocytes were counted and 5\u00d710 4  cells were centrifuged onto cytospin slides for differential staining as described. Remaining cells were then plated out into standard tissue culture plates to allow macrophages to adhere for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Non-adherent cells were collected, washed and the pellet re-suspended in media as described for PBMCs. These BAL cells were then placed in 48-well plates at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2  and stimulated on the same day as collection as described below for PBMC and BAL cells. For each volunteer we ensured that paired BAL cells collected at each bronchoscopy were processed and incubated using the same serum lot number and lymphocyte count/well during stimulation.\nPneumococcal whole cell ELISA\nWhole 23F (P833) and 6B (BHN418) strains were used as the capture antigen to determine the antibody titer to the pneumococcus in collected NW, BAL and serum. The whole cell ELISA assay was performed as previously described  [34] . Briefly, bacteria stocks were grown in Todd Hewitt broth containing 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to an optical density (OD 600 nm ) of 0.5. The bacterial pellet collected after centrifugation was then re-suspended in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer to an OD 600 nm  of 1. This bacterial suspension was added to 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) (50 \u00b5l per well) and the plates were incubated overnight at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Eight-fold serial dilutions of samples in 0.1% BSA were added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in triplicate. Antigen-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected using alkaline-phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) and biotin conjugated goat anti-human IgA (AbD serotec, UK), respectively, followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (AbD serotec, UK). 0.5 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was added as a substrate. The OD was measured at 405 nm using a FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech, UK). The assigned titer value was determined as the last dilution in which OD is above 0.1.\nMeasurement of anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies by ELISA\nAnti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies were determined using the internationally standardised method and reagents  [35] . Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were coated using 5 \u00b5g/ml of purified polysaccharides 6B or 23F (Statens Serum Institute) for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C. Wells were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (PBS-F) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T between each step. Samples were diluted in PBS-F containing 10 \u00b5g/ml cell wall polysaccharide mixture (CWPS Multi, Statens Serum Institute) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. When CWPS Multi is used, separate adsorption with the 22F capsule, is not required. 89-SF5 reference serum received from U.S. Food and Drug Administration was used as a standard. Diluted/adsorbed samples were then transferred to pre-coated plates and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) for 2 hours at room temperature. 0.5 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was added as a substrate. Optical densities were measured at 405 nm using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech, UK). All samples were run in triplicate in four dilutions. Results are expressed as \u00b5g/ml calculated using the assigned IgG concentrations in reference serum 89-SF5.\nMeasurement of anti-pneumococcal protein antibodies\nThe recombinant proteins PspA (clade1)  [36]  and PspC (group 5)  [37]  (GenBank accession numbers AY082387 and EF424119.1) were kindly provided by Dr Eliane Miyaji (Butantan Institute, Brazil). Pneumolysin toxoid (PdB) was provided by Prof. Aras Kadioglu (University of Leicester, UK) and PsaA by Dr Eddie Ades (CDC Atlanta, GA). Purified proteins were used to coat ELISA plates at 1 \u00b5g/ml overnight. The assay was then performed as described above for the pneumococcal whole cell ELISA. Anti-PspA and anti-PspC concentrations were calculated using reference serum samples with known concentrations assigned in the laboratory of Prof. David Briles and Prof. Susan Hollingshead for PspA, (both University of Alabama, USA) and Prof. Helena K\u00e4yhty for PspC, (National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland). All samples were run in triplicate in four dilutions. Anti-PdB and anti-PsaA concentrations are expressed in arbitrary units per ml calculated using a standard serum sample.\nWestern blot analysis\nWe prepared whole cell extracts (WCE) and choline chloride extracts (CCE) from the inoculated 23F pneumococcal strain grown in THY to 0.6 OD 600 nm . The cell pellet from 50 ml culture was lysed in a solution containing 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% sodium desoxycholate, 0.15 M sodium citrate  [38]  or 2% choline chloride  [39] , respectively. Choline chloride extraction is more effective at releasing the choline binding proteins on the pneumococcal surface. Protein extracts (5 \u00b5g of WCE and 3 \u00b5g of CCE) were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Individual lanes were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 6 h with matched pre- and post-challenge NW samples (1\u223625 diluted) from inoculated volunteers. Protein-specific antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich). Detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (GE Healthcare). Comparisons were only made between experiments in which the antibody incubation and development of membranes were performed at the same time to control for assay variation.\nPreparation of pneumococci for cell stimulation experiments\nSerotype 23F and 6B  S. pneumoniae  were grown to mid-log phase in Vegitone broth (Oxoid) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . To obtain pneumococcal culture supernatant, broth cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered first through 0.45 \u00b5m pore size and then 0.2 \u00b5m filters to remove remaining bacteria. Filtrate was then concentrated 10-fold by adding to pre-sterilised 10 K molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin concentrators (VWR) and centrifuging at 836 g for 25 mins at room temperature. This processed cell supernatant from culture broth defined here as '23F c/s' or '6B c/s' was stored at -20\u00b0C. Sterile Vegitone broth was processed under the same conditions and used as a control for stimulation experiments ('vehicle'). Mid-log phase 6B pellet was killed by heat treatment for 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C and kept at -20\u00b0C in single use aliquots in PBS. The protein content of 23F c/s, 6B c/s, 6B pellet and vehicle was determined by Bradford assay. In addition, ethanol-killed acapsulate derived type 2  S. pneumoniae  (gift of Prof. R Malley, Boston, USA) at a concentration of 1\u00d710 6  cells/ml was used as an  in vitro  pneumococcal challenge, relevant to the development of that product as a novel vaccine  [10] .\nPBMC and BAL cell stimulation\nWe collected PBMC and BAL samples from 19 volunteers before and after challenge with 23F or 6B to determine whether nasal challenge with pneumococcus was associated with alteration in pneumococcal antigen-specific memory CD4 T cell responses in either compartment. PBMC and BAL cells from volunteers challenged with 23F were stimulated  in vitro  with the following antigens: 23F c/s (0.395 \u00b5g/ml), vehicle (0.26 \u00b5g/ml), 10 6 /ml whole pneumococcal cells (acapsulate derived type 2 donated and prepared  [33]  by Prof. Malley), 0.45 \u00b5g/ml heat-inactivated influenza vaccine (Split Virion, Sanofi Pasteur 2009/2010 strains) or left untreated ('NS'). All experiments were performed in a volume of 1 ml in 48-well plates. PBMC and BAL cells from volunteers challenged with 6B were similarly stimulated  in vitro  with the following antigens: heat killed 6B whole cells (1.0 \u00b5g/ml), 6B c/s (13 \u00b5g/ml of which 4.2 \u00b5g/ml was pneumococcal protein), vehicle (13 \u00b5g/ml), 10 6 /ml whole pneumococcal cells (acapsulate derived type 2 donated by Prof. Malley), 0.45 \u00b5g/ml heat-inactivated influenza (Split Virion, Sanofi Pasteur 2010/2011 strains) or left untreated ('NS'). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 0.5 \u00b5g/ml (final concentration) as a positive control. Antigen titration experiments were performed to determine the optimum concentration required for stimulation. Cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. After 2 hours, 1 \u00b5l Brefeldin A (BD Biosciences, UK) was added and incubated for a further 16 hours before harvesting and staining for the presence of intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry.\nIntracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis\nCells challenged with antigen as above were spun to a pellet, supernatant discarded and the cells stained for flow cytometry. Cells were stained with Vivid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) to allow discrimination between viable and non-viable cells. Cells were then stained for CD3, CD4 and CD45RO using the following mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies, APC conjugated CD3, APC-H7 conjugated CD4, PE-Cy7 conjugated CD45RO (all Becton Dickinson) on ice. Cells were fixed and permeabilised (Cytofix/Perm) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) then stained for intracellular IFNgamma, TNF and IL-17 using mouse anti-human antibodies: AF 700  conjugated IFN-gamma, AF 488  conjugated TNF, PE conjugated IL-17 (all BD Biosciences, UK). Cells were fixed prior to acquisition on a BD LSR2 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, UK). We gated viable, memory CD4 T cells (CD4+CD45RO+) and performed a Boolean gating strategy (data not shown) to identify the proportion of TNF, IFNgamma and IL-17 producing cells (or combinations thereof) following  in vitro  stimulation with Influenza (positive control), whole pneumococci or pneumococcal culture supernatant from the respective challenge strain. In order to correct for inter-subject variation in the response to the Vegitone broth, all culture supernatant stimulated data were corrected by subtracting the percentage of CD4+CD45RO+ cells producing cytokine when cultured with Vegitone media alone (\"vehicle\") from the pneumococcal antigen stimulated response. Responses to media alone were subtracted from Influenza or whole cell stimulated cells to determine specific responses.\nStatistical analysis\nImmunoglobulin and flow cytometry data were tested to determine the distribution of the data. Data with a normal distribution (Shapiro Wilks) were compared with parametric tests (paired students' t-test for before vs after inoculation) and for data not following a normal distribution; the Wilcoxon-matched pairs test was used. Flow cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo software version 7.6 (Treestar Oregon, USA). Graph and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad prism version 5.0 (California, USA). Differences were considered significant if p\u22640.05.\n"], "ner": [[], [], [], [], [[17859, 17862, "GENE"], [17972, 17975, "GENE"], [18176, 18184, "GENE"], [18186, 18189, "GENE"], [18254, 18263, "GENE"], [18284, 18287, "GENE"], [18449, 18452, "GENE"], [18462, 18465, "GENE"], [18562, 18565, "GENE"], [18567, 18575, "GENE"]], [[18963, 18966, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "sentences": ["\nRecruitment and ethics\nHealthy adult volunteers were enrolled with written informed consent to a study involving inoculation of either  Streptococcus pneumoniae  type 23F or 6B, the two studies performed consecutively. We recruited non-smoking adults aged between 18 and 60 years with no history or signs of systemic or respiratory disease. Individuals who were already naturally colonised with pneumococcus or had regular contact with at risk individuals, such as young children, were excluded from the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee, Sefton, Liverpool (08/H1001/52) and the study was sponsored by the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals Trust.\nStudy design\nSamples of blood, serum, nasal wash (NW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were obtained before and after bacterial challenge according to two different sampling protocols ( Figure 1 ). Volunteers in our first study were intra-nasally challenged with two doses of 23F ( Figure 1A ) and in the second study a single dose of 6B ( Figure 1B )  S. pneumoniae  was used. In the 23F challenge cohort NW samples were collected 2 weeks and 1 week before inoculation and on days 2, 4, and 7 after each inoculation. In the 6B challenge cohort ( Figure 1B ) NWs were collected 2 weeks before challenge and 2 and 7 days following inoculation. NWs were then collected once per week for 5 consecutive weeks. A final set of post-challenge samples (blood, serum, NW and BAL) were then collected at 6 weeks.\n23F and 6B preparation and volunteer inoculation\nClinical isolates of  S. pneumoniae  serotype 23F (P833 a gift of Prof. JN Weiser, University of Pennsylvania) and 6B (BHN418 a gift of Prof. P Hermans, University of Nijmegen) were used for inoculation. Bacterial stocks were grown to mid-log phase in Vegitone broth (Oxoid)  [29]  in order to avoid volunteer exposure to animal products and stored in 1 ml aliquots of Vegitone with 10% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich) at -80\u00b0C. Serotype confirmation was performed using latex agglutination (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen) and was confirmed by an independent reference laboratory (Health Protection Agency, Colindale, UK).\nOn each day of inoculation two aliquots were thawed, centrifuged and bacterial pellets were washed once before being re-suspended and diluted in sterile 0.9% saline to reach the desired concentration of bacteria. For the 23F cohort 9,000 CFU/naris in 100 \u00b5l saline were used for the first inoculation. If colonisation was not established following this inoculation we performed a second inoculation with 20,000 CFU/naris in 100 \u00b5l saline. For the 6B cohort 40,000CFU/100 \u00b5l/naris was administered. Volunteers tilted their head slightly back and 100 \u00b5l of bacterial suspension was dropped onto each naris using a P200 pipette taking care not to touch the mucosa. Serial dilutions of the original inocula were plated onto blood agar for dose confirmation ( Table 1 ).\n\n           10.1371/journal.ppat.1002622.t001 \n           Table 1 \n           23F and 6B cohort study details.", " \n           \n             \n           \n             \n                 \n                 \n               \n                 \n               \n                   23F \n                   6B \n                 \n                   \n               \n                 \n               Total number of volunteers \n                   8 \n                   11 \n                 \n                   \n                 Gender (M\u2236F) \n                   4\u22364 \n                   4\u22367 \n                 \n                   \n                 Age (mean\u00b1SD) \n                   31\u00b116 \n                   25\u00b16 \n                 \n                   \n                 st  challenge dose (per naris) (mean\u00b1SD) 1 \n                   8,791\u00b11,935 \n                   44,576\u00b112,815 \n                 \n                   \n                 nd  challenge dose (per naris) (mean\u00b1SD) 2 \n                   13,830\u00b14,504 \n                   n/a \n                 \n                   \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n        \nNasal washing and determination of carriage\nNW samples were collected before and after challenge and processed as previously described  [30] .

At instillation, the subject was invited to hold their breath and push gently on the back of the upper teeth with their tongue. Saline was held in the nasopharynx for 5 seconds and then poured out by gently tipping the head forward while holding a Petri dish under the nose. The samples collected from each naris were pooled. This process was performed once for the 6B cohort but 3 times for the 23F cohort. Samples were transferred immediately to the laboratory for processing. The first pooled aliquot obtained from each NW visit in both cohorts was used to determine carriage status (all negative except for one volunteer) and pneumococcal specific immunoglobulin analysis. NW samples were spun at 3345 g for 10 minutes and the supernatant stored at -80\u00b0C. The pellet was re-suspended in 100 \u00b5l of skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol (STGG) preservative medium prior to plating. 25 \u00b5l was plated onto Columbia Horse Blood Agar (Oxoid) with gentamicin (Sigma) and the remainder diluted to 1 ml with STGG and plated (50 \u00b5l) on blood and chocolate agar (Oxoid) for determination of co-colonising flora. Remaining STGG samples were stored at -80\u00b0 for long term storage  [31]  and confirmation if needed. Plates were inspected after 24 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2  and alpha haemolytic, draughtsman-like colonies were sub-cultured to determine pneumococcal phenotype. Optochin sensitivity, bile solubility and latex agglutination testing were performed to confirm pneumococcal phenotype. Subjects in whom pneumococci were not detected from NW samples collected on at least 2 consecutive visits were defined as non-colonised. Colonised subjects are defined as subjects in whom pneumococci was recovered from any nasal wash.\nThe numbers of lymphocytes in NW were too few for analysis of cognate antigen specific T cell responses using flow cytometry. We measured the NW total cell count and also examined stained cytospin slides for increased numbers of cellular effectors and mucus deposits. Total cell counts in NW were determined from pooled aliquots 2 and 3 from the 23F cohort. Cells were pelleted at 400 g and resuspended in PBS. Cell counts were performed using 10 \u00b5l of cell suspension and a haemocytometer, with the final count given per ml of NW fluid returned. The remainder was pelleted as above and re-suspended in 50 \u00b5l of PBS and centrifuged onto a microscope slide using a cytocentrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 5 mins at 450 rpm. For the 6B cohort a representative sample of 10 \u00b5l was taken from STGG preparations (described above). These samples were made up to 50 \u00b5l with PBS and cytospins were prepared as described.", " Microscope slides were allowed to air dry before staining with Hemacolor rapid staining set (Merck, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An arbitrary semi-quantitative scoring system was used to assign whether an increase, decrease or no change had occurred.\nBlood processing\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from volunteer samples using Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PBMCs were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2  at a concentration of 5\u00d710 5  cells per ml/well in a 48-well plate in RPMI 1640 media with 2 mM L-glutamine (both Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% human AB serum (Invitrogen, UK). Cells were stimulated on the same day as collection.\nSerum was obtained from clotted whole blood collected into serum monovettes (Sarstedt, UK). Samples were centrifuged at 2560 g for 7 minutes. Serum was taken and stored at -80\u00b0C for immunoglobulin analysis.\nBAL processing\nBronchoscopy was performed using topical local anaesthesia with minimal sedation and BAL collected as described previously  [32] . Briefly, four aliquots, totalling 200 mls, of warm 0.9% saline was instilled and gently retrieved from a sub-segmental bronchus of the right middle lobe by gentle hand suction and the BAL placed into sterile pots on ice. BAL was processed as previously described  [33] . Briefly, whole BAL was filtered through muslin to remove mucus and 3 ml of unprocessed BAL was stored at -80\u00b0C. The whole sample was centrifuged at 470 g for 10 minutes. BAL supernatant was stored at -80\u00b0C for immunoglobulin analysis. BAL cells were re-suspended in RPMI 1640 media as described for PBMCs with the addition of antibiotics (penicillin 40 U/ml, streptomycin 40 \u00b5g/ml, neomycin 80 \u00b5g/ml (all P4083, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.5 \u00b5g/ml of amphotericin B (A2942, Sigma-Aldrich). Total BAL macrophages and lymphocytes were counted and 5\u00d710 4  cells were centrifuged onto cytospin slides for differential staining as described. Remaining cells were then plated out into standard tissue culture plates to allow macrophages to adhere for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Non-adherent cells were collected, washed and the pellet re-suspended in media as described for PBMCs. These BAL cells were then placed in 48-well plates at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2  and stimulated on the same day as collection as described below for PBMC and BAL cells. For each volunteer we ensured that paired BAL cells collected at each bronchoscopy were processed and incubated using the same serum lot number and lymphocyte count/well during stimulation.\nPneumococcal whole cell ELISA\nWhole 23F (P833) and 6B (BHN418) strains were used as the capture antigen to determine the antibody titer to the pneumococcus in collected NW, BAL and serum. The whole cell ELISA assay was performed as previously described  [34] . Briefly, bacteria stocks were grown in Todd Hewitt broth containing 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to an optical density (OD 600 nm ) of 0.5. The bacterial pellet collected after centrifugation was then re-suspended in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer to an OD 600 nm  of 1. This bacterial suspension was added to 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) (50 \u00b5l per well) and the plates were incubated overnight at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Eight-fold serial dilutions of samples in 0.1% BSA were added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in triplicate. Antigen-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected using alkaline-phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) and biotin conjugated goat anti-human IgA (AbD serotec, UK), respectively, followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (AbD serotec, UK). 0.5 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was added as a substrate. The OD was measured at 405 nm using a FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech, UK). The assigned titer value was determined as the last dilution in which OD is above 0.1.", "\nMeasurement of anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies by ELISA\nAnti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies were determined using the internationally standardised method and reagents  [35] . Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were coated using 5 \u00b5g/ml of purified polysaccharides 6B or 23F (Statens Serum Institute) for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C. Wells were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (PBS-F) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T between each step. Samples were diluted in PBS-F containing 10 \u00b5g/ml cell wall polysaccharide mixture (CWPS Multi, Statens Serum Institute) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. When CWPS Multi is used, separate adsorption with the 22F capsule, is not required. 89-SF5 reference serum received from U.S. Food and Drug Administration was used as a standard. Diluted/adsorbed samples were then transferred to pre-coated plates and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) for 2 hours at room temperature. 0.5 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was added as a substrate. Optical densities were measured at 405 nm using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech, UK). All samples were run in triplicate in four dilutions. Results are expressed as \u00b5g/ml calculated using the assigned IgG concentrations in reference serum 89-SF5.\nMeasurement of anti-pneumococcal protein antibodies\nThe recombinant proteins PspA (clade1)  [36]  and PspC (group 5)  [37]  (GenBank accession numbers AY082387 and EF424119.1) were kindly provided by Dr Eliane Miyaji (Butantan Institute, Brazil). Pneumolysin toxoid (PdB) was provided by Prof. Aras Kadioglu (University of Leicester, UK) and PsaA by Dr Eddie Ades (CDC Atlanta, GA). Purified proteins were used to coat ELISA plates at 1 \u00b5g/ml overnight. The assay was then performed as described above for the pneumococcal whole cell ELISA. Anti-PspA and anti-PspC concentrations were calculated using reference serum samples with known concentrations assigned in the laboratory of Prof. David Briles and Prof. Susan Hollingshead for PspA, (both University of Alabama, USA) and Prof. Helena K\u00e4yhty for PspC, (National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland). All samples were run in triplicate in four dilutions. Anti-PdB and anti-PsaA concentrations are expressed in arbitrary units per ml calculated using a standard serum sample.\nWestern blot analysis\nWe prepared whole cell extracts (WCE) and choline chloride extracts (CCE) from the inoculated 23F pneumococcal strain grown in THY to 0.6 OD 600 nm . The cell pellet from 50 ml culture was lysed in a solution containing 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% sodium desoxycholate, 0.15 M sodium citrate  [38]  or 2% choline chloride  [39] , respectively. Choline chloride extraction is more effective at releasing the choline binding proteins on the pneumococcal surface. Protein extracts (5 \u00b5g of WCE and 3 \u00b5g of CCE) were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Individual lanes were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 6 h with matched pre- and post-challenge NW samples (1\u223625 diluted) from inoculated volunteers. Protein-specific antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich). Detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (GE Healthcare). Comparisons were only made between experiments in which the antibody incubation and development of membranes were performed at the same time to control for assay variation.\nPreparation of pneumococci for cell stimulation experiments\nSerotype 23F and 6B  S. pneumoniae  were grown to mid-log phase in Vegitone broth (Oxoid) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . To obtain pneumococcal culture supernatant, broth cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered first through 0.45 \u00b5m pore size and then 0.2 \u00b5m filters to remove remaining bacteria.", " Filtrate was then concentrated 10-fold by adding to pre-sterilised 10 K molecular weight cut-off Vivaspin concentrators (VWR) and centrifuging at 836 g for 25 mins at room temperature. This processed cell supernatant from culture broth defined here as '23F c/s' or '6B c/s' was stored at -20\u00b0C. Sterile Vegitone broth was processed under the same conditions and used as a control for stimulation experiments ('vehicle'). Mid-log phase 6B pellet was killed by heat treatment for 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C and kept at -20\u00b0C in single use aliquots in PBS. The protein content of 23F c/s, 6B c/s, 6B pellet and vehicle was determined by Bradford assay. In addition, ethanol-killed acapsulate derived type 2  S. pneumoniae  (gift of Prof. R Malley, Boston, USA) at a concentration of 1\u00d710 6  cells/ml was used as an  in vitro  pneumococcal challenge, relevant to the development of that product as a novel vaccine  [10] .\nPBMC and BAL cell stimulation\nWe collected PBMC and BAL samples from 19 volunteers before and after challenge with 23F or 6B to determine whether nasal challenge with pneumococcus was associated with alteration in pneumococcal antigen-specific memory CD4 T cell responses in either compartment. PBMC and BAL cells from volunteers challenged with 23F were stimulated  in vitro  with the following antigens: 23F c/s (0.395 \u00b5g/ml), vehicle (0.26 \u00b5g/ml), 10 6 /ml whole pneumococcal cells (acapsulate derived type 2 donated and prepared  [33]  by Prof. Malley), 0.45 \u00b5g/ml heat-inactivated influenza vaccine (Split Virion, Sanofi Pasteur 2009/2010 strains) or left untreated ('NS'). All experiments were performed in a volume of 1 ml in 48-well plates. PBMC and BAL cells from volunteers challenged with 6B were similarly stimulated  in vitro  with the following antigens: heat killed 6B whole cells (1.0 \u00b5g/ml), 6B c/s (13 \u00b5g/ml of which 4.2 \u00b5g/ml was pneumococcal protein), vehicle (13 \u00b5g/ml), 10 6 /ml whole pneumococcal cells (acapsulate derived type 2 donated by Prof. Malley), 0.45 \u00b5g/ml heat-inactivated influenza (Split Virion, Sanofi Pasteur 2010/2011 strains) or left untreated ('NS'). Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 0.5 \u00b5g/ml (final concentration) as a positive control. Antigen titration experiments were performed to determine the optimum concentration required for stimulation. Cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. After 2 hours, 1 \u00b5l Brefeldin A (BD Biosciences, UK) was added and incubated for a further 16 hours before harvesting and staining for the presence of intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry.\nIntracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis\nCells challenged with antigen as above were spun to a pellet, supernatant discarded and the cells stained for flow cytometry. Cells were stained with Vivid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) to allow discrimination between viable and non-viable cells. Cells were then stained for CD3, CD4 and CD45RO using the following mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies, APC conjugated CD3, APC-H7 conjugated CD4, PE-Cy7 conjugated CD45RO (all Becton Dickinson) on ice. Cells were fixed and permeabilised (Cytofix/Perm) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences) then stained for intracellular IFNgamma, TNF and IL-17 using mouse anti-human antibodies: AF 700  conjugated IFN-gamma, AF 488  conjugated TNF, PE conjugated IL-17 (all BD Biosciences, UK). Cells were fixed prior to acquisition on a BD LSR2 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, UK). We gated viable, memory CD4 T cells (CD4+CD45RO+) and performed a Boolean gating strategy (data not shown) to identify the proportion of TNF, IFNgamma and IL-17 producing cells (or combinations thereof) following  in vitro  stimulation with Influenza (positive control), whole pneumococci or pneumococcal culture supernatant from the respective challenge strain.", " In order to correct for inter-subject variation in the response to the Vegitone broth, all culture supernatant stimulated data were corrected by subtracting the percentage of CD4+CD45RO+ cells producing cytokine when cultured with Vegitone media alone (\"vehicle\") from the pneumococcal antigen stimulated response. Responses to media alone were subtracted from Influenza or whole cell stimulated cells to determine specific responses.\nStatistical analysis\nImmunoglobulin and flow cytometry data were tested to determine the distribution of the data. Data with a normal distribution (Shapiro Wilks) were compared with parametric tests (paired students' t-test for before vs after inoculation) and for data not following a normal distribution; the Wilcoxon-matched pairs test was used. Flow cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo software version 7.6 (Treestar Oregon, USA). Graph and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad prism version 5.0 (California, USA). Differences were considered significant if p\u22640.05.\n"]}

Whether CII could induce ACAID in the arthritis-prone DBA/1 or C57BL/6 mice remains to be elucidated. We used DTH assays to test for the inhibition of CII-specific inflammatory responses. The procedure included priming the mice in the AC with CII (day 0) followed by immunizing subcutaneously with CII emulsified with CFA on day 7. This was followed with ear-testing of the AC-induced mice by intradermal injections of CII on day 14. Results showed significant inhibition of DTH responses compared to positive control mice that did not receive the AC injection, which confirmed that mice primed in AC with CII did develop peripheral tolerance (Fig.  1 ). This clearly shows that CII injection into the AC of DBA/1 and C57BL/6 mice could induce ACAID. The statistical significance data of experiments on C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice was as follows: Figure  1 A (C57BL/6): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.00009 (24 h) and * P  = 0.00023 (48 h); Figure  1 B (DBA/1): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.0035 (24 h); * P  = 0.00048 (48 h).\n -generated Type II collagen-specific ACAID APCs induced ACAID in C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice\nWe adoptively transferred ACAID APCs into na\u00efve C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice on day 0 to examine the hypothesis that  in vitro -generated CII-specific ACAID APCs induce peripheral tolerance in C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice. The protocol for generating ACAID APCs is described in the methods section. On day 7, the recipient mice were subcutaneously immunized with CII emulsified with CFA. These mice were challenged with CII  via  intradermal injections in the ear on day 14. The significant suppression of DTH responses observed in these mice as compared with the positive control mice that did not receive ACAID APCs shows that tail vein injection of CII-specific ACAID APCs induced immune tolerance in both arthritis-prone strains of mice (Fig.  2 A and B). The statistical significance data of experiments on C57BL/6 and DBA/1 mice was as follows: Figure  2 A (C57BL/6): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.004 (24 h); * P  = 0.0025 (48 h); Figure  2 B (DBA/1): ACAID mice  versus  positive control, * P  = 0.000012 (24 h); * P  = 0.00029 (48 h).\n -generated ACAID Tregs impaired DTH responses\nWe previously showed that Tregs capable of suppressing DTH responses could be generated  via  the AC injection of CII in Balb/c mice [ 17 ]. Here, we tested whether CII-specific putative Tregs generated  in vitro  could impair DTH responses. Using LAT assay, the cultures were examined for the generation of putative Tregs 5-7 days after the co-culture of  in vitro -generated CII-specific ACAID APCs and spleen cells isolated from na\u00efve mice. Briefly, spleen cells were isolated from na\u00efve and CII/CFA-immunized mice. Approximately, 1 \u00d7 10 6  CII-specific putative Tregs were mixed with an equal number of immune spleen cells (containing effector cell populations harvested from CII-immunized mice) and CII (500 \u03bcg). Of 10 mM acetic acid, 20 \u03bcl injected into the right ear pinna was used as an internal control and the suspension (20 \u03bcl) was inoculated through intradermal injection into the left ear pinna of na\u00efve C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice. Injections of CII-immunized spleen cells and na\u00efve spleen cells with CII constituted the positive control. The negative control received only na\u00efve spleen cells (2 \u00d7 10 6  cells) in addition to the CII. Impaired DTH responses to CII as compared to the positive control were demonstrated in recipients of  in vitro -generated CII-specific putative Tregs. As expected, negative ear swelling responses have been observed in the negative control.

{"doc_key": "4302655_Materials and methods", "text": ["\nMice\nC57BL6 and DBA/1 mice (6-8 weeks of age) were procured from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All animals were maintained at the animal care facility of the Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. Experiments were conducted in accordance to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Wayne State University.\nACAID induction  via  the AC injection of type II collagen\nWe used the Hamilton automatic dispensing apparatus (Hamilton, Whittier, CA, USA) to induce ACAID in C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice as described in our previous publications [ 7 , 19 ]. Isoflurane anaesthesia (2-3% isoflurane with oxygen supply) is used to anaesthetize C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice. The AC of the eye is injected with about 50-100 \u03bcg of CII in 10 mM acetic acid (in 5 \u03bcl; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Controls are the mice injected with 10 mM acetic acid alone  via  AC injection. This was followed by a subcutaneous immunization of 250 \u03bcg of CII (Sigma-Aldrich) on day 7. The CII was emulsified 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; Sigma-Aldrich). Of the CII/CFA emulsion, 200 \u03bcl was injected to each animal. Either a DTH assay or a LAT assay was performed on day 14 after the AC injection of CII as explained below.\nGeneration of ACAID APCs\nAs described previously, ACAID APCs were generated  in vitro  [ 7 , 19 ]. ACAID APCs from C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice were generated as described before [ 20 ]. Briefly, at concentrations of TGF-beta2 that are similar to those present in the aqueous humor of the eye, APCs (2 \u00d7 10 6  cells/ml) were cultured overnight in complete RPMI 1640 with 10 mg/ml CII and 2-5 ng/ml TGF-beta2 (R&D Systems).\n  generation of ACAID Tregs\nAn  in vitro  spleen cell culture system that we previously used to generate Tregs that express the same properties and surface markers as Tregs produced  in vivo  has been used [ 7 , 19 ]. Functional Tregs can directly inhibit DTH responses [ 21 ]. To a 100 mm Petri dish containing 5 \u00d7 10 7  spleen cells harvested from normal C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice, CII-specific ACAID APCs (5 \u00d7 10 6 ) were added and incubated for 5-7 days at 37\u00b0C before testing for the presence of Tregs.\nImmunization by subcutaneous injection\nSubcutaneous injection of 250 \u03bcg of CII (Sigma-Aldrich) emulsified 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to perform mice immunization. Each mouse received 200 \u03bcl of the CII/CFA emulsion.\nDTH assay\nDelayed-type hypersensitivity responses are inhibited in association with ACAID induction [ 22 - 26 ]. DTH assays were performed in a similar manner as previously described [ 17 ]. Briefly, left ear pinnae were injected intradermally with \u223c500 \u03bcg of CII in 20 \u03bcl. Right ear pinnae were injected with 20 \u03bcl of 10 mM acetic acid (internal control). Seven days after the subcutaneous immunization with CII/CFA, DTH assays were performed. The engineer's micrometer (Mitutoyo, Japan) was used to perform ear swelling measurements before and 24 h after CII injection. The results were measured as: specific ear swelling = (24 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for left ear - (24 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for right ear. Results after 48 h were calculated in a similar manner: specific ear swelling = (48 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for left ear - (48 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for right ear.\nLAT assay\nDetails of the LAT assay have been previously described [ 7 , 17 , 19 ].

All animals were maintained at the animal care facility of the Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. Experiments were conducted in accordance to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Wayne State University.\nACAID induction  via  the AC injection of type II collagen\nWe used the Hamilton automatic dispensing apparatus (Hamilton, Whittier, CA, USA) to induce ACAID in C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice as described in our previous publications [ 7 , 19 ]. Isoflurane anaesthesia (2-3% isoflurane with oxygen supply) is used to anaesthetize C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice. The AC of the eye is injected with about 50-100 \u03bcg of CII in 10 mM acetic acid (in 5 \u03bcl; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Controls are the mice injected with 10 mM acetic acid alone  via  AC injection. This was followed by a subcutaneous immunization of 250 \u03bcg of CII (Sigma-Aldrich) on day 7. The CII was emulsified 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; Sigma-Aldrich). Of the CII/CFA emulsion, 200 \u03bcl was injected to each animal. Either a DTH assay or a LAT assay was performed on day 14 after the AC injection of CII as explained below.\nGeneration of ACAID APCs\nAs described previously, ACAID APCs were generated  in vitro  [ 7 , 19 ]. ACAID APCs from C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice were generated as described before [ 20 ]. Briefly, at concentrations of TGF-beta2 that are similar to those present in the aqueous humor of the eye, APCs (2 \u00d7 10 6  cells/ml) were cultured overnight in complete RPMI 1640 with 10 mg/ml CII and 2-5 ng/ml TGF-beta2 (R&D Systems).\n  generation of ACAID Tregs\nAn  in vitro  spleen cell culture system that we previously used to generate Tregs that express the same properties and surface markers as Tregs produced  in vivo  has been used [ 7 , 19 ]. Functional Tregs can directly inhibit DTH responses [ 21 ]. To a 100 mm Petri dish containing 5 \u00d7 10 7  spleen cells harvested from normal C57BL6 and DBA/1 mice, CII-specific ACAID APCs (5 \u00d7 10 6 ) were added and incubated for 5-7 days at 37\u00b0C before testing for the presence of Tregs.\nImmunization by subcutaneous injection\nSubcutaneous injection of 250 \u03bcg of CII (Sigma-Aldrich) emulsified 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to perform mice immunization. Each mouse received 200 \u03bcl of the CII/CFA emulsion.\nDTH assay\nDelayed-type hypersensitivity responses are inhibited in association with ACAID induction [ 22 - 26 ]. DTH assays were performed in a similar manner as previously described [ 17 ]. Briefly, left ear pinnae were injected intradermally with \u223c500 \u03bcg of CII in 20 \u03bcl. Right ear pinnae were injected with 20 \u03bcl of 10 mM acetic acid (internal control). Seven days after the subcutaneous immunization with CII/CFA, DTH assays were performed. The engineer's micrometer (Mitutoyo, Japan) was used to perform ear swelling measurements before and 24 h after CII injection. The results were measured as: specific ear swelling = (24 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for left ear - (24 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for right ear. Results after 48 h were calculated in a similar manner: specific ear swelling = (48 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for left ear - (48 h measurement - 0 hr measurement) for right ear.\nLAT assay\nDetails of the LAT assay have been previously described [ 7 , 17 , 19 ]. Putative Tregs (1 \u00d7 10 6  cells in 10 \u03bcl) with spleen cells (1 \u00d7 10 6  cells in 10 \u03bcl) collected from subcutaneously immunized donors and 500 \u03bcg CII were injected to the left ear pinnae of na\u00efve mice.

{"doc_key": "4016835_5. Discussion", "text": ["\nThe renin-angiotensin system is a major endocrine/paracrine system that regulates blood pressure (BP) in our body [ 49 ], genes encoding components of this system have been strong candidates for the investigation of the genetic basis of essential hypertension and major targets for antihypertensive drugs [ 50 ]. However, previous studies in south India mainly focus on limited gene of RAS [ 47 ,  48 ,  51 ]; thus we carried out a case-control study to systemically investigate the association between polymorphisms in RAS genes and essential hypertension. The present study identifies gender specific genetic variants in RAS genes that may play crucial roles in BP regulation and susceptibility for hypertension. A significantly higher frequency of the  AGT  235TT was observed in female patients when compared to the female controls.  ACE  DD was more prevalent in male patients when compared with male controls. So,  AGT  M235T was associated with EHT in females and  ACE  I/D was associated with males in our study population. Association of T variant with the essential hypertension in our study has shown agreement with some studies.\nJeunemaitre et al., 1992 [ 4 ], were the first to report the linkage of the molecular variants M235T with hypertension in the Caucasians. Subsequent studies among the UK/Chinese/Malaysian/south Indian supported the former finding [ 15 ,  40 ,  47 ,  48 ,  52 ] while a study of Germany/North India is inconsistent with the previous report  [ 47 ,  53 ]. The association studies in the Africans/African-Americans mostly found a negative association [ 54 ,  55 ], but the high frequency of T allele was observed in this population and it is associated with increase in plasma and mRNA  AGT  concentration [ 11 ,  55 ,  56 ].\nThe frequency of the 235T variant (major allele in our study) was 0.746 for this study among cases and this frequency was similar to study already reported in Chinese (0.73) and Hong Kong Chinese (0.82) population [ 16 ,  57 ]. The frequency of 235T variant in the 1000 genome project was found to be 0.87 in Africans, 0.64 in Americans, and 0.84 in Asians but the frequency was deviated in Europeans with the frequency of 0.41 [ 58 ]. Several studies in south India has reported that the 235T frequencies are in the range of 0.56-0.81 in the patients [ 13 ,  59 - 61 ]. But in north India the frequency was reported to be 0.31 in the cases [ 44 ]. Prasad and colleague have performed a comparative study of north and south India in control subjects and 235T variant frequency was found to be 0.33 and 0.52, respectively [ 62 ]. These overall results show that 235T variant is predominantly present in south India compared to north India. Our study showed a higher OR 2.62 (95% CI, 1.24-5.76;  P  = 0.006) compared to a recent meta-analysis [ 15 ] in Han Chinese population which reports high association between  AGT  M235T polymorphism and hypertension (OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.16-2.03;  P  = 0.002). On the contrary, another meta-analysis of 126 studies by Sethi et al. (2003) has reported that odds ratio for hypertension was 1.19 (1.10 to 1.30) in TT individuals in white subjects and 1.60 (1.19 to 2.15) in Asian subjects and it was not associated with SBP or DBP [ 63 ]. Instead, M235T genotype was associated with a stepwise increase in angiotensinogen levels in white subjects and a corresponding increase in risk of hypertension in both White and Asian subjects [ 63 ]. In another meta-analysis, the frequencies of the AGT T allele were 80% in cases and 72% in controls. The pooled OR (with 95% CI) of TT versusMT + MM was 1.76 (1.44-2.16) ( P  < 0.00001) with T versus M of 1.54 (1.31-1.81). The pooled OR of MM versus MT + TT was 0.67 (0.45-1.00) ( P  = 0.05) [ 16 ].\nIn this study, the significantly higher prevalence of 235T allele in female patients is in agreement with the previous report that the T allele was significantly more prevalent among female ETH than in control subjects [ 4 ]. In contrast, Freire et al. (1998) [ 64 ] found that the  AGT  M235T homozygous mutation genotype was significantly higher in males compared to females. Earlier studies have found that plasma  AGT  levels in postmenopausal women are slightly higher [ 65 ] than in men [ 66 ]. Plasma angiotensinogen levels are more increased in M235T variant than the 235 M variant with administration of ethinyl estradiol (EE), a synthetic estrogen. The  AGT  G (-6) variant is less transcriptionally active with lower levels of  AGT  mRNA [ 16 ,  67 ] and a significant linkage disequilibrium between M235T and G-6A was also reported. These findings reveals that G-6A polymorphism, which is linked to nonfunctioning M235T, increased the plasma  AGT  level via regulation of  AGT  gene transcription and was involved in the pathogenesis of the predisposition to hypertension. Thus, sex hormones such as estrogen might bind to the core promoter region and enhance the transcription of  AGT  gene. However, it is also can be hypothesized that estrogen may bind to the -6A variant more effectively and  AGT  gene expression could be more in this variant. Hence, the angiotensinogen promoter is directly controlled by estrogen [ 68 ,  69 ].\nThe I/D allelic variant (intronic deletion of a 287 bp Alu sequence repetitive element, D allele) is one of the most intensively investigated genetic polymorphism in the field of hypertension and cardiovascular disease research [ 70 ,  71 ]. In the present study, dominant model of  ACE  gene in male (II + ID versus DD) is associated with EHT in south Indian and it was also observed that I allele has a protective role. Overrepresentation of D allele in male cases represents strong association in pathogenesis of hypertension in male. This is in accordance with the previous report by many studies [ 72 - 74 ]. Our study showed a lower OR 0.401 (95% CI 0.224-0.718;  P  < 0.01) compared to a recent meta-analysis [ 22 ] in whole Chinese population which reports high association with  ACE  DD polymorphism with hypertension (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.17-1.46;  P  < 0.01). The D allele of  ACE  was initially suggested to be associated with increased levels of serum  ACE  activity as compared with I variant [ 75 ,  76 ]. In contrast to this, Zee et al. (1992) has reported that \"I\" allele was associated with high blood pressure in an Australian population with strong evidence of familial hypertension [ 77 ]. In recent meta-analysis, the distribution of the D allele frequency was 0.45 for the EH group and 0.40 for the control group. The summary OR for the distribution frequency of D allele was 1.27 (5% CI 1.17-1.37). The heterogeneity among the 67 studies was also significant ( P  < 0.00001,  I (2) = 71.4%). There was a significant association between distribution frequency of the D allele and EH risk in Han, Kazakh, Tibetan, Zhuang, and unclassified nationalities ( P  < 0.05). Contradictory result was observed in the national minorities, such as Mongolian, Uighur, Yi, Dongxiang, Yugu, Korean and Gamel, and the  D  allele; and EH risk was not significant ( P  > 0.05) [ 22 ].\nThe mechanism of the sex specific association with hypertension remains unclear. One notion is that estrogen protects against hypertension. Even though estrogen upregulates the  AGT  gene expression but it again acts as negative feedback mechanism in controlling renin secretion and then the  ACE  secretion in RAS [ 78 ]. Sex differences exist in the regulation of arterial pressure and renal function by RAS. This may in part stem from a differential balance in the pressor and depressor arms of the RAS (Hilliard et al., 2013). In males, the  ACE /AngII/ AGTR1  pathways are enhanced, whereas, in females, the balance is shifted towards the  ACE2 /Ang(1-7)/MasR (Mas receptor) and angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) pathways [ 79 ]. Studies reported that premenopausal women, as compared to age matched men, are protected from renal and cardiovascular disease, and this differential balance of the RAS between the sexes likely contributes [ 80 ,  81 ].\nThere were some limitations in this study. First, the age and sex match case control was not available in the sample studied. Our approach is based on a sample with a relatively homogeneous genetic background, and therefore the results are unlikely to be affected by unmeasured confounding factors of population stratification. This study did not measure central obesity and psychiatric comorbidities, the major risk factor for hypertension. There are no measurements of plasma angiotensinogen levels or other markers of RAS activation available to correlate directly with the genetic polymorphisms investigated in this study.\n"], "ner": [[[238, 260, "DISEASE"], [535, 557, "DISEASE"], [702, 714, "DISEASE"], [757, 760, "GENE"], [839, 842, "GENE"], [922, 925, "GENE"], [937, 952, "RELATION"], [953, 956, "DISEASE"], [973, 976, "GENE"], [1067, 1089, "DISEASE"], [1248, 1260, "DISEASE"], [1726, 1729, "GENE"], [2853, 2869, "RELATION"], [2879, 2882, "GENE"], [2907, 2919, "DISEASE"], [3075, 3087, "DISEASE"], [3388, 3400, "DISEASE"], [3491, 3494, "GENE"]], [[4025, 4028, "GENE"], [4160, 4163, "GENE"], [4406, 4409, "GENE"], [4481, 4484, "GENE"], [4697, 4700, "GENE"], [4727, 4730, "GENE"], [4813, 4825, "DISEASE"], [4936, 4939, "GENE"], [5051, 5054, "GENE"], [5367, 5379, "DISEASE"], [5384, 5406, "DISEASE"], [5471, 5474, "GENE"], [5704, 5716, "DISEASE"], [5976, 5979, "GENE"], [6002, 6014, "DISEASE"], [6075, 6078, "GENE"], [6153, 6156, "GENE"], [6377, 6389, "DISEASE"], [7128, 7140, "DISEASE"], [7203, 7215, "DISEASE"], [7255, 7258, "GENE"], [7370, 7373, "GENE"], [7623, 7626, "GENE"], [7722, 7726, "GENE"], [7737, 7741, "GENE"], [7743, 7755, "GENE"], [7761, 7788, "GENE"], [7790, 7796, "GENE"]], [[8398, 8405, "DISEASE"], [8463, 8475, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[2879, 2882, 2907, 2919, "relation undefined"]], [], []], "triplets": [[[2879, 2882, 2907, 2919, 2853, 2869]], [], []], "triplets_text": [[["AGT", "hypertension", "high association"]], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2], "sentences": ["\nThe renin-angiotensin system is a major endocrine/paracrine system that regulates blood pressure (BP) in our body [ 49 ], genes encoding components of this system have been strong candidates for the investigation of the genetic basis of essential hypertension and major targets for antihypertensive drugs [ 50 ].

{"doc_key": "4016835_3. Results Rev", "text": ["\n3.1.  AGT  M235T Polymorphism\nThe genotype distribution of M235T polymorphism was significantly different between case and control subjects. Taking the MM genotype of the  AGT  M235T polymorphism as a reference, association of the MT genotype was 2.40 (95% CI: 1.11-5.37) and TT genotype was 2.62 (95% CI: 1.24-5.76), indicating a dominant effect of the T on risk and T allele is highly associated with hypertension in our recessive model ( Table 4 ). Allelic association does not withstand after multiple corrections (alpha value 0.05/4 = 0.013;  Table 2 ). Furthermore, the samples were segregated for subgroup analysis on the basis of gender and T allele was associated with the female patients (OR: 0.522; 95% CI: 0.330-0.826) after applying the Bonferroni corrections (Tables  2  and  3 ).\n3.2.  ACE  I/D Polymorphism\nConsidering I/D polymorphism, the distribution of genotypes did not differ significantly between EHT patients and controls through a slight increase in the frequency of DD (39.34%) homozygous that was observed among patients as compared to controls (31.75%) ( Table 3 ). However, our results revealed overrepresentation of \"I\"-allele carriers (homozygous II and heterozygous ID) in male control subjects ( Table 4 ) which suggests its protective role in studied population. This association was estimated as odds ratio of 0.401 with 95% CI 0.224-0.718 and withstand after multiple correction ( Table 4 ).\n3.3.  ACE  G2350A Polymorphism\nThe genotype distribution of  ACE  G2350A polymorphism did not differ significantly between EHT patients and control subjects, and the allele frequencies were in HWE in both groups (Tables  3  and  4 ).\n3.4.  AGTR1  A1166C Polymorphism\nGenotyping frequencies of A1166C polymorphisms were identified for all the EHT patients and control subjects. Our result shows that there is no significant difference in genotype and allelic frequencies in EHT patients and controls. Furthermore, the allele frequencies are consistent with the HWE in both cases and controls (Tables  2  and  3 ).\n3.5. Analysis of Epistatic Interaction\nTo elaborate the findings of the analysis, MDR analysis was applied to detect and characterize high-order gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions in cases and controls.   Figure 1  illustrates the MDR interaction information analysis of all four polymorphisms studied gene, represented in the form of a dendrogram. The MDR analysis shows synergistic effect of  ACE  and  AGT  polymorphisms in the EHT patients. To improve the quality of analysis and identify the disease risk, we have carried out combination analysis and haplotype frequencies on the basis of the polymorphism pairs selected by MDR analysis. Similar analysis between gene-environmental interactions showed moderate synergistic effect of the marker  AGT  M235T and  ACE  I/D with the sex in the development of EHT ( Figure 1 ).   Table 5 \n    summarizes the results of the MDR analysis evaluated for all possible combinations of the polymorphisms studied for the risk of developing hypertension. It shows the best model with a combination of polymorphisms in order along with its prediction error and coefficient of variation (CV) consistency. Result reveals the interaction of  AGT  M235T- ACE  I/D polymorphisms as the overall best models with least prediction error of 0.39 and CV consistency of 10/10. High-risk (dark grey) and low-risk (light grey) genotypic combinations were determined based on the threshold value, which was 1.0 (211/211) for the present data. It was observed that TT genotype of  AGT  M235T polymorphism when present in combination with DD genotype of  ACE  I/D polymorphism conferred a 2.5 times higher risk (56/22) for developing EHT ( Figure 2 ).\nAssociation studies of genetic polymorphisms and trait for detecting the complex diseases remain controversial. However, the association study of allele and genotype frequencies of candidate genes with the unaffected and affected subjects to understand the genetic etiology of complex human traits remains an efficient method [ 39 - 41 ]. Taking this method into consideration, we determined the possible association of genetic polymorphisms of RAS genes with EHT with the south Indian subjects. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have been published in RAS gene polymorphisms with the genotype and allele based association study in Indian subjects. But, large number of studies has reported association between EHT and  ACE   [ 42 - 45 ] or  AGT   [ 46 - 48 ] gene polymorphism but lack of haplotype based association of the RAS gene with the EHT in south Indian population. Probably this could be the first comprehensive reports on RAS gene polymorphisms with association study of genotype and haplotype in relation to EHT in south Indian subjects.\nA total of 422 subjects were recruited for this study, out of which 211 subjects were cases and 211 subjects were controls. Among the patients, 109 (51.66%) are males and 102 (48.34%) are females, whereas in control subjects 130 (61.61%) are males and 81 (38.99%) are females ( Table 1 ). The mean age of control subjects is  43.71 \u00b1 14.17 years for males and 43.90 \u00b1 13.57 years for females. The mean ages of male patients are 54.56 \u00b1 13.04 years and 54.37 \u00b1 12.25 years for females. The difference in the distribution of epidemiological features were found to be significant between cases and controls with respect to gender ( \u03c7 \u00b2 =  4.26;  P  = 0.039).\nGenotype distributions of all four studied polymorphisms were compatible with HWE expectation in cases as well as in controls. Differences between cases and controls in allele/genotype frequency distributions that were observed for  AGT  M235T and  ACE  I/D polymorphism (Tables  2  and  3 ) with T and D allele are more prevalent in cases than in controls except for  ACE  I/D polymorphism in females.

AGT  M235T Polymorphism\nThe genotype distribution of M235T polymorphism was significantly different between case and control subjects. Taking the MM genotype of the  AGT  M235T polymorphism as a reference, association of the MT genotype was 2.40 (95% CI: 1.11-5.37) and TT genotype was 2.62 (95% CI: 1.24-5.76), indicating a dominant effect of the T on risk and T allele is highly associated with hypertension in our recessive model ( Table 4 ). Allelic association does not withstand after multiple corrections (alpha value 0.05/4 = 0.013;  Table 2 ). Furthermore, the samples were segregated for subgroup analysis on the basis of gender and T allele was associated with the female patients (OR: 0.522; 95% CI: 0.330-0.826) after applying the Bonferroni corrections (Tables  2  and  3 ).\n3.2.  ACE  I/D Polymorphism\nConsidering I/D polymorphism, the distribution of genotypes did not differ significantly between EHT patients and controls through a slight increase in the frequency of DD (39.34%) homozygous that was observed among patients as compared to controls (31.75%) ( Table 3 ). However, our results revealed overrepresentation of \"I\"-allele carriers (homozygous II and heterozygous ID) in male control subjects ( Table 4 ) which suggests its protective role in studied population. This association was estimated as odds ratio of 0.401 with 95% CI 0.224-0.718 and withstand after multiple correction ( Table 4 ).\n3.3.  ACE  G2350A Polymorphism\nThe genotype distribution of  ACE  G2350A polymorphism did not differ significantly between EHT patients and control subjects, and the allele frequencies were in HWE in both groups (Tables  3  and  4 ).\n3.4.  AGTR1  A1166C Polymorphism\nGenotyping frequencies of A1166C polymorphisms were identified for all the EHT patients and control subjects. Our result shows that there is no significant difference in genotype and allelic frequencies in EHT patients and controls. Furthermore, the allele frequencies are consistent with the HWE in both cases and controls (Tables  2  and  3 ).\n3.5. Analysis of Epistatic Interaction\nTo elaborate the findings of the analysis, MDR analysis was applied to detect and characterize high-order gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions in cases and controls.   Figure 1  illustrates the MDR interaction information analysis of all four polymorphisms studied gene, represented in the form of a dendrogram. The MDR analysis shows synergistic effect of  ACE  and  AGT  polymorphisms in the EHT patients. To improve the quality of analysis and identify the disease risk, we have carried out combination analysis and haplotype frequencies on the basis of the polymorphism pairs selected by MDR analysis. Similar analysis between gene-environmental interactions showed moderate synergistic effect of the marker  AGT  M235T and  ACE  I/D with the sex in the development of EHT ( Figure 1 ).   Table 5 \n    summarizes the results of the MDR analysis evaluated for all possible combinations of the polymorphisms studied for the risk of developing hypertension. It shows the best model with a combination of polymorphisms in order along with its prediction error and coefficient of variation (CV) consistency. Result reveals the interaction of  AGT  M235T- ACE  I/D polymorphisms as the overall best models with least prediction error of 0.39 and CV consistency of 10/10.

{"doc_key": "4016835_1. Introduction", "text": ["\n\nHuman essential hypertension (EHT) is a multifactorial trait with a complex genetic basis. This complex disease is due to the consequence of an interaction between various environmental and genetic factors and it plays a major role in blood pressure (BP) variation [ 1 ]. It does not follow the Mendelian mode of transmission [ 2 ]. The genetic contribution is estimated to be between 30% and 40% of BP variation [ 3 ]. In recent years, a series of genes have been proposed to influence the mechanism of blood pressure. Some evidences of association between these genes had been reported [ 4 - 6 ] but on the contrary these associations were not always significant [ 7 ].\nMore than 150 candidate genes have been implicated in the regulation of blood pressure that is linked to several pathways. Among these genes, RAS has significant direct involvement in the BP regulation as it is reported in several studies and most of the antihypertensive drugs are targeting this system. The genetic variation of RAS encoding genes, angiotensinogen ( AGT ), angiotensin-1-converting enzyme ( ACE ), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AGTR1 ), were associated with EHT and have been important genes for the association studies in various populations [ 8 - 10 ].  AGT , the natural substrate of RAS, is synthesized in the liver and released into blood circulation. The potential role of  AGT  gene in hypertension was originally explored by Jeunemaitre group through linkage and association study in the causation of human EHT in Utah and French populations [ 4 ].  AGT  variants have been shown to associate with serum  AGT  in black and white children, providing a potential mechanism for genetic associations [ 11 ,  12 ]. Among the identified major molecular variants of  AGT , M235T and T174 M variants had a significant association with hypertension [ 13 ]. But associations with these variants are found to be contradictory in different populations [ 14 ]. Two different meta-analyses in Chinese populations have also confirmed that T allele of  AGT  M235T polymorphism is associated with essential hypertension [ 15 ,  16 ].\n\n ACE  is a key zinc metalloenzyme of the RAS and is widely distributed in the kidney [ 17 ]. The  ACE  catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the biologically active peptide, angiotensin II, which is involved in the control of fluid electrolyte balance and systemic blood pressure [ 18 ]. This polymorphism is characterized by the presence (insertion) or absence (deletion) of a 287 bp AluYa5 element inside intron 16. Although I/D polymorphism is located in intronic region of the  ACE  gene, several investigators have found that the D allele is related to increased activity of  ACE  in serum. The highest serum  ACE  activity was seen in the DD genotype while the lowest was seen in the II genotype [ 19 ]. Among the  ACE  gene polymorphisms of exon 17, G2350A variant has the most significant effect on plasma  ACE  concentrations as it accounts for 19% of the total variance in  ACE  plasma levels.  ACE  I/D is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with  ACE  G2350A and both the variants are associated with essential hypertension with contradictory result [ 20 ,  21 ]. Meta-analyses in different studies also found that DD genotype of  ACE  I/D polymorphism [ 22 ,  23 ] and AA genotype of ACE G2350A polymorphism are associated with essential hypertension [ 24 ].\nThe  AGTR1 , a receptor for angiotensin II, is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor super family expressed in most tissues, where receptor activation leads to vasoconstriction, water retention, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and hypertrophy [ 25 ,  26 ]. The polymorphism A1166C in the 3' untranslated region of the  AGTR1  gene was detected in study by Bonnardeaux et al., (1994) who also identified its association with hypertension [ 27 ]. Several recent findings and meta-analysis reported that it is associated with essential hypertension [ 28 ,  29 ]; however, conflicting results are also reported by few studies [ 30 ,  31 ].\nThe goal of the present analysis is to assess the effect of a combination of variants at different loci of pathophysiological pathway of RAS genes in south Indian population. In this case-control study, we examined possible associations between polymorphisms of the  AGT ,  ACE , and  AGTR1  genes and hypertension in the south Indian population age between 30 and 70 years. We therefore determined the association between  AGT  M235T,  ACE  I/D,  ACE  G2350A, and  AGTR1  A1166C polymorphisms in the study population.\n"], "ner": [[[8, 30, "DISEASE"], [32, 35, "DISEASE"], [1024, 1039, "GENE"], [1042, 1045, "GENE"], [1049, 1080, "GENE"], [1083, 1086, "GENE"], [1094, 1124, "GENE"], [1127, 1132, "GENE"], [1157, 1160, "GENE"], [1255, 1258, "GENE"], [1360, 1374, "RELATION"], [1379, 1382, "GENE"], [1392, 1404, "DISEASE"], [1514, 1517, "DISEASE"], [1557, 1560, "GENE"], [1612, 1615, "GENE"], [1767, 1770, "GENE"], [1805, 1833, "RELATION"], [1834, 1846, "DISEASE"], [2044, 2047, "GENE"], [2071, 2086, "RELATION"], [2087, 2109, "DISEASE"], [2126, 2129, "GENE"], [2223, 2226, "GENE"], [2614, 2617, "GENE"], [2713, 2716, "GENE"], [2747, 2750, "GENE"], [2853, 2856, "GENE"], [2947, 2950, "GENE"], [3016, 3019, "GENE"], [3037, 3040, "GENE"], [3086, 3089, "GENE"], [3270, 3273, "GENE"], [3324, 3327, "GENE"], [3352, 3367, "RELATION"], [3368, 3390, "DISEASE"], [3404, 3409, "GENE"], [3737, 3742, "GENE"], [3825, 3841, "RELATION"], [3842, 3854, "DISEASE"], [3941, 3963, "DISEASE"]], [[4269, 4290, "RELATION"], [4321, 4324, "GENE"], [4328, 4331, "GENE"], [4339, 4344, "GENE"], [4356, 4368, "DISEASE"], [4478, 4481, "GENE"], [4491, 4494, "GENE"], [4502, 4505, "GENE"], [4520, 4525, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[1379, 1382, 1392, 1404, "relation undefined"], [1767, 1770, 1834, 1846, "relation undefined"], [2044, 2047, 2087, 2109, "relation undefined"], [3324, 3327, 3368, 3390, "relation undefined"], [3737, 3742, 3842, 3854, "relation undefined"]], [[4321, 4324, 4356, 4368, "relation undefined"], [4328, 4331, 4356, 4368, "relation undefined"], [4339, 4344, 4356, 4368, "relation undefined"]]], "triplets": [[[1379, 1382, 1392, 1404, 1360, 1374], [1767, 1770, 1834, 1846, 1805, 1833], [2044, 2047, 2087, 2109, 2071, 2086], [3324, 3327, 3368, 3390, 3352, 3367], [3737, 3742, 3842, 3854, 3825, 3841]], [[4321, 4324, 4356, 4368, 4269, 4290], [4328, 4331, 4356, 4368, 4269, 4290], [4339, 4344, 4356, 4368, 4269, 4290]]], "triplets_text": [[["AGT", "hypertension", "potential role"], ["AGT", "hypertension", "significant association with"], ["AGT", "essential hypertension", "associated with"], ["ACE", "essential hypertension", "associated with"], ["AGTR1", "hypertension", "association with"]], [["AGT", "hypertension", "possible associations"], ["ACE", "hypertension", "possible associations"], ["AGTR1", "hypertension", "possible associations"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\n\nHuman essential hypertension (EHT) is a multifactorial trait with a complex genetic basis.

{"doc_key": "5302952_RESULTS", "text": ["\nDelphinidin induces apoptosis in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells\nDelphinidin, the major anthocyanidin compound in pigmented fruits and vegetables, possesses a diphenylpropane-based, polyphenolic-ring structure and has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-angiogenic activity (Figure  1A ). Previously published reports also suggest that treatment of prostate cancer cells with delphinidin results in an efficient, dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. Hafeez et al. (2008) of the University of Wisconsin observed that whereas delphinidin exerts a differential dose response effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells, it did not affect the viability of normal prostate epithelial cells [ 6 ].\nTo examine the mechanism of delphinidin-induced apoptosis, we first examined the cytotoxic effect of delphinidin on human prostate cancer cells using a cell viability assay. Delphinidin did not affect the viability of Du145 or PC3 cells at any of the used concentrations, whereas it had a clear dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on LNCaP cells. (Figure  1B ).\nIn order to confirm that the aforementioned changes in viability were a result of delphinidin-induced apoptosis, we microscopically observed and applied the TUNEL assay on prostate cancer cell lines after a 12-hour treatment with 100-\u03bcM delphinidin. As shown in Figure  1C , delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells displayed changes in morphology that relate to apoptosis, whereas Du145 and PC3 cells did not exhibit similar changes in cellular morphology. The TUNEL assay can be used to detect dead or dying cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation, which is a sign of apoptosis. After delphinidin-treated cells were stained, the dead cells were measured in a multiplex microplate reader (Figure  1D ). As seen in Figure  1D , treatment of LNCaP cells with delphinidin resulted in the appearance of labeled dead cells. In contrast, no stained cells were detected in delphinidin-treated Du145 and PC3 cultures. Therefore, both the morphological observations and the TUNEL assay results indicate that delphinidin induces apoptosis of LNCaP cells. The fact that LNCaP cells are wt-p53 positive, while the two unaffected cancer cell lines, Du145 or PC3, do not express functional p53, suggests that delphinidin induces apoptosis in a p53-dependent fashion.\nDelphinidin induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in LNCaP cells\nCaspases play a major role in cancer cell apoptosis. Caspases-8 and-9 directly or indirectly activate the effector caspases-3 and -7, which serve as key factors in the apoptosis signaling pathway [ 23 ]. To investigate the mechanism of delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, we examined the activation of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9, as well as the cleavage of PARP-1 in the cytosol. PARP-1 is a substrate of effector caspases, so the presence or absence of the cleaved form is a clear indication of whether or not caspases play an essential role in delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells. Prostate cancer cells were incubated with various concentrations of delphinidin (50, 100, and 150 mM) for 24 h, while non-treated cells served as controls. In LNCaP cells, delphinidin treatment led to an increase in the expression of caspases-8 and to higher levels of the cleaved forms of caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP-1, whereas no changes were observed in Du145 and PC3 cells (Figure  2A ). These results clearly suggest that the delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells was initiated by caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 cleaved caspases-3 and -7 activating them. Truly, our experiments showed that delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells was accompanied by a significant increase in caspase activity (Figure  2B ). In turn, the activated effector caspases cleaved their substrate, PARP-1. As a whole, our results suggest that delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCap is mediated by caspase activation.\nTo confirm the role of the caspase cascade in the delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells, we tried to inhibit apoptosis by blocking caspase activation with a general caspase inhibitor (zVAD). LNCaP cells were incubated with 100 \u03bcM delphinidin for 24 h, in the presence or absence of zVAD. As shown in Figure  2C , caspase activation in delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells was inhibited by zVAD treatment. We proceeded to examine the effect of zVAD, as well as the effect of a specific inhibitor of caspases-3 and -7, zDQMD, on the delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells. The caspase-3/-7 activity analysis showed that the delphinidin-induced activation of these two caspases was significantly inhibited by zDQMD (Figure  2D ). To evaluate whether the inhibition of caspases-3 and -7 decreases the cytotoxicity that is caused by delphinidin treatment, we performed another viability assay. The inhibitor effectively blocked caspase activity and reduced cytotoxicity. Therefore, the inactivation of caspases by zVAD or zDQMD dramatically inhibits delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells (Figure  2E ). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that delphinidin promotes apoptosis in these cells by activating the effector caspases-3 and -7.\nDelphinidin antagonizes HDAC3 activity and increases the cytotoxicity of LNCaP cells\nHistone modifications regulate the activation and stabilization of histones and non-histone proteins. HATs and HDACs dynamically regulate chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and gene expression. The main function of HDACs is the repression of gene transcription via deacetylation of lysine residues in histones or non-histones [ 24 ]. HDAC3 is known to regulate the transcription of genes through its effect on chromatin conformation [ 25 ,  26 ], and its functions have been demonstrated in many research studies. Recently, we reported the existence of three novel HDAC3-interacting partners, L3MBTL1, CREB3, and PDCD5, and described roles of HDAC3 in epigenetic regulation mediated by these proteins [ 27 ]. It is our belief that HDAC3 is an important regulatory factor of proliferation, growth homeostasis, and apoptosis of cancer cells during various cellular events.\nTo determine whether the mechanism through which delphinidin induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells includes downregulation of HDAC3 activity; we measured total HDAC activity in cells treated with delphinidin. HDAC activity was decreased by delphinidin in both PC3 cells and LNCaP cells. However, the reduction was much greater in LNCaP cells. (Figure  3A ). We then examined whether delphinidin is a global or a specific HDAC inhibitor. As seen in Figure  3B , delphinidin reduced the activity of HDAC3 activity to a greater extent compared to the activity of the other class I HDACs. We concluded that delphinidin induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells via the specific inhibition of HDAC3 activity. To examine the mechanism through which the reduction of HDAC3 activity takes place, we determined the protein levels of class I HDACs and PARP-1 in delphinidin-treated cancer cells using western blot analysis. As shown in Figure  3C , delphinidin treatment dramatically reduced HDAC3 expression and induced PARP-1 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that delphinidin induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells through the suppression of HDAC3 expression and deacetylase activity. To confirm that the suppression of HDAC activity leads to apoptosis, we examined the viability of LNCaP cells that were incubated with 100 \u03bcM delphinidin alone, or together with either TSA, a general HDAC inhibitor, or MS-275, a specific HDAC1/3 inhibitor. As expected, in both cases of co-treatment the viability of LNCaP cells was lower compared to the viability of cells treated with delphinidin alone. We also examined whether knocking down HDAC3 using siRNA enhanced the apoptotic effect of delphinidin in LNCaP cells. As shown in Figure  3D , HDAC3-knocked down cells treated with delphinidin displayed a significantly lower viability compared to normally expressing HDAC3 cells treated with delphinidin alone or co-treated with delphinidin and HDAC inhibitors. Thus, HDAC3 RNAi-mediated knockdown can enhance the apoptotic effect of delphinidin on LNCaP cells. Taken together, our findings reveal that HDAC3 is a critical factor in delphinidin-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.\nDelphinidin-induced HDAC3 cleavage leads to p53 acetylation in LNCaP cells\nVarious studies have reported that LNCaP cells harbor two functional alleles encoding wild-type p53, whereas DU145 cells express a modified p53 protein with two point mutations (Phe223Leu and Val274Phe) and PC3 cells are deficient in functional p53 protein production. To further support the finding that delphinidin-induced apoptosis is mediated by a downregulation of HDAC3 expression and activity, we examined the effects of different concentrations of delphinidin on p53 acetylation. According to previous reports [ 28 ,  29 ], HDAC3 is cleaved because of sorbitol-induced caspase-7 activation, or during FasL-mediated apoptosis. As p53 is one of the targets of the deacetylases activity of HDAC3, the cleavage of HDAC3 during apoptosis results in an increase in p53 acetylation, whereas the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes is activated. Based on these reports, we proceeded to examine whether an increase in p53 acetylation due to HDAC3 cleavage is also taking place in delphinidin-induced apoptosis. LNCaP cells and DU145 cells treated with delphinidin (50 and 100 mM), as well as untreated controls, were examined using western blot analysis. The apoptotic effect of delphinidin in LNCaP cells was accompanied by cleavage of both PARP-1 and HDAC3 (Figure  4A ). The cleaved form of HDAC3 can be detected using an anti-HDAC3 antibody raised against the N-terminal region of anti-HDAC3, whereas antibodies recognizing the C-terminal region are not able to bind to cleaved HDAC3.\nWe then determined whether p53 acetylation and stability were enhanced by HDAC3 cleavage during delphinidin-induced apoptosis. LNCaP cells were treated with different doses of delphinidin for 24 h. As shown in Figure  4B , delphinidin increased p53 acetylation and stability, whereas HDAC3 was cleaved by activated caspase-7 in delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells, in which apoptosis was induced. We also examined the effect of two other anthocyanidins, cyanidin and aurantinidin, on the p53 acetylation status. As shown in Figure  4C , delphinidin increased p53 acetylation and stability to a greater extent compared to that by cyanidin and aurantinidin.\nTo demonstrate that endogenous p53 is stabilized for activation in response to delphinidin, p53 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of LNCaP cells treated with delphinidin and/or glutaraldehyde (a protein-protein crossinker). Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C and detected by western blot analysis using an anti-p53 antibody. These results show that the stabilization and activation of p53 were induced by enhancing the oligomerization of p53 (Figure  4D ), whereas it is known that oligomerization of p53 is essential for enhancing p53 activity for DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, post-translational modification, and stabilization [ 30 ]. As a whole, these findings suggest that delphinidin induced p53-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP cells through p53 oligomerization.\nDelphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells is mediated by activation of p53 and inactivation of HDAC3\nAccording to recent reports, p53-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells is regulated by post-translational modification of p53, including acetylation. Therefore, we examined the results of knocking down HDAC1 or HDAC3 on the stability of p53, on the p53 acetylation levels, as well as on the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins p21 and BAX (which is regulated by p53), in delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells. Treatment of LNCaP cells with delphinidin and si-HDAC1 or si-HDAC3 increased total p53 and acetylated-p53 protein levels, as well as the expression of p21 and BAX proteins, whereas the increase was greater when HDAC3 was knocked down (Figure  5A ). We also performed a cell viability assay, where treatment of LNCaP cells with si-HDAC3 and delphinidin led to increased cytotoxicity. We conclude that HDAC3 inhibition enhances the apoptotic effect of delphinidin in LNCaP cells.\nTo demonstrate that endogenous p53 undergoes oligomerization in delphinidin-treated cells, p53 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of LNCaP cells treated with delphinidin and/or si-HDAC3, and visualized using western blot analysis. As seen in Figure  5C , p53 oligomerization was increased in delphinidin-treated LNCaP HDAC3 knockdown cells, compared to the delphinidin-treated cells whose HDAC3 expression had not been reduced by si-RNA treatment. We conclude that HDAC3 is directly involved in p53-dependent apoptosis. To further study the effect of HDAC3 on p53 stability in the presence of delphinidin, we overexpressed Flag-fused proteins containing wild-type HDAC3, or a point-mutation of the protein (HDAC3 D309A ), or a C-terminal deletion mutant (HDAC3 DeltaC ). Overexpression of wild-type HDAC3 and HDAC3 D309A  inhibited the ability of delphinidin to induce acetylation and stabilization of p53. The expression of p21 and BAX proteins was reduced (Figure  5D ) and the cells became resistant to delphinidin-induced cytotoxicity (Figure  5E ). In contrast, overexpression of HDAC3 DeltaC  did not inhibit the effects of delphinidin on p53 levels, p53 acetylation, p21 and BAX expression, or cytotoxicity (Figure  5D, Figure 5E ). We next examined whether the p53 oligomerization caused by delphinidin is negatively regulated by HDAC3. As shown in Figure  5F , HDAC3 overexpression is able to inhibit the oligomerization of p53 in delphinine-treated LNCaP cells.\nDelphinidin-induced HDAC3 downregulation leads LNCaP cells to apoptosis via the activation of p53 target genes\nRecent studies have demonstrated that the cleavage of HDAC3 in the apoptotic signaling pathway enhances the expression of p53-regulated pro-apoptotic genes [ 22 ,  29 ]. To examine the activation of the transcription of p53 target genes because of delphinidin treatment, we created reporter plasmids consisting of the promoters of three genes,  p21 ,  Bax , and  Noxa , and the coding sequence of luciferase. The promoters of these three genes contain p53 binding elements and are activated by p53. We transiently transfected LNCaP cells with the reporter plasmids and treated the cells with delphinidin for 24 h. As shown in Figure  6A , delphinidin treatment led to the activation of all three promoters. We conclude that delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells is accompanied by the transcriptional activation of p53-upregulated pro-apoptotic genes. We next examined the role of HDAC3 in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. HDAC3 knockdown dramatically enhanced the expression of  p53  and the pro-apoptotic genes  Bax ,  p21 ,  Puma , and  Noxa . HDAC1 knockdown did not have a similar effect on the expression of these genes (Figure  6B ). We also performed experiments where wild-type and mutant forms of HDAC3 were overexpressed. As shown in Figure  6C , overexpressing of HDAC3 wt  and HDAC3 D391A  suppressed the delphinidin-induced transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, whereas HDAC3 DeltaC  did not affect the transcription of these genes. Therefore, our results demonstrate that HDAC3 is cleaved by effector-caspases in response to delphinidin-initiated cell death signaling, resulting in the transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic target genes, including  Puma ,  Bax , and  Noxa . As shown in Figure  6D , delphinidin treatment of LNCaP cells results in activation of effector caspases, whereas activated caspase-3 cleaves HDAC3. These results suggest that HDAC3 cleavage leads to the hyperacetylation and oligomerization of p53, as well as to the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes during delphinidin-induced apoptosis in p53 wild-type human prostate cancer cells.\n"], "ner": [[[46, 61, "DISEASE"], [358, 373, "DISEASE"], [610, 625, "DISEASE"], [830, 845, "DISEASE"], [1238, 1253, "DISEASE"], [2131, 2134, "GENE"], [2229, 2232, "GENE"], [2283, 2286, "GENE"], [2399, 2405, "DISEASE"], [2736, 2742, "GENE"], [2759, 2765, "GENE"], [2971, 2986, "DISEASE"], [3261, 3270, "GENE"], [3272, 3281, "GENE"], [3287, 3293, "GENE"], [3467, 3476, "GENE"], [3489, 3498, "GENE"], [3765, 3771, "GENE"]], [[5165, 5170, "GENE"], [5569, 5574, "GENE"], [5800, 5805, "GENE"], [5828, 5835, "GENE"], [5837, 5842, "GENE"], [5848, 5853, "GENE"], [5878, 5883, "GENE"], [5966, 5971, "GENE"], [5988, 6005, "RELATION"], [6061, 6067, "DISEASE"], [6227, 6232, "GENE"], [6598, 6603, "GENE"], [6780, 6785, "GENE"], [6852, 6857, "GENE"], [6934, 6940, "GENE"], [7074, 7079, "GENE"], [7243, 7248, "GENE"], [7524, 7529, "GENE"], [7731, 7736, "GENE"], [7835, 7840, "GENE"]], [[7959, 7964, "GENE"], [8060, 8065, "GENE"], [8195, 8200, "GENE"], [8264, 8279, "DISEASE"], [8313, 8318, "GENE"], [8337, 8340, "GENE"], [8464, 8467, "GENE"], [8508, 8511, "GENE"], [8613, 8616, "GENE"], [8738, 8743, "GENE"], [8839, 8842, "GENE"], [8900, 8905, "GENE"], [8945, 8954, "GENE"], [9005, 9008, "GENE"], [9063, 9068, "GENE"], [9086, 9091, "GENE"], [9135, 9138, "GENE"], [9286, 9289, "GENE"], [9309, 9314, "GENE"], [9610, 9616, "GENE"], [9621, 9626, "GENE"], [9662, 9667, "GENE"], [9698, 9703, "GENE"], [9758, 9763, "GENE"], [9850, 9855, "GENE"], [9884, 9887, "GENE"], [9931, 9936, "GENE"], [10102, 10105, "GENE"], [10141, 10146, "GENE"], [10341, 10344, "GENE"], [10412, 10415, "GENE"], [10540, 10543, "GENE"], [10601, 10604, "GENE"], [10839, 10842, "GENE"], [10913, 10916, "GENE"], [10966, 10969, "GENE"], [11239, 11242, "GENE"], [11285, 11288, "GENE"], [11380, 11383, "GENE"], [11404, 11409, "GENE"], [11439, 11442, "GENE"], [11466, 11472, "DISEASE"], [11530, 11533, "GENE"], [11610, 11615, "GENE"], [11619, 11624, "GENE"], [11645, 11648, "GENE"], [11657, 11660, "GENE"], [11740, 11743, "GENE"], [11748, 11751, "GENE"], [11775, 11778, "GENE"], [11866, 11871, "GENE"], [11878, 11883, "GENE"]], [[11900, 11903, "GENE"], [11919, 11922, "GENE"], [11968, 11971, "GENE"], [11976, 11979, "GENE"], [12028, 12033, "GENE"], [12147, 12152, "GENE"], [12217, 12222, "GENE"], [12326, 12329, "GENE"], [12386, 12389, "GENE"], [12481, 12486, "GENE"], [12619, 12624, "GENE"], [12690, 12695, "GENE"], [12766, 12771, "GENE"], [12852, 12857, "GENE"], [12861, 12864, "GENE"], [12965, 12970, "GENE"], [13008, 13013, "GENE"], [13056, 13061, "GENE"], [13100, 13105, "GENE"], [13110, 13115, "GENE"], [13203, 13206, "GENE"], [13226, 13229, "GENE"], [13234, 13237, "GENE"], [13386, 13391, "GENE"], [13446, 13449, "GENE"], [13458, 13461, "GENE"], [13475, 13478, "GENE"], [13483, 13486, "GENE"], [13570, 13573, "GENE"], [13639, 13644, "GENE"], [13671, 13676, "GENE"], [13734, 13737, "GENE"], [13793, 13798, "GENE"], [13867, 13870, "GENE"], [13938, 13943, "GENE"], [14006, 14009, "GENE"], [14104, 14107, "GENE"], [14229, 14232, "GENE"], [14236, 14239, "GENE"], [14247, 14251, "GENE"], [14336, 14339, "GENE"], [14378, 14381, "GENE"], [14705, 14708, "GENE"], [14771, 14776, "GENE"], [14819, 14824, "GENE"], [14876, 14879, "GENE"], [14910, 14913, "GENE"], [14917, 14920, "GENE"], [14924, 14928, "GENE"], [14936, 14940, "GENE"], [14943, 14948, "GENE"], [15103, 15108, "GENE"], [15172, 15177, "GENE"], [15186, 15191, "GENE"], [15280, 15285, "GENE"], [15383, 15388, "GENE"], [15566, 15570, "GENE"], [15574, 15577, "GENE"], [15585, 15589, "GENE"], [15716, 15725, "GENE"], [15734, 15739, "GENE"], [15768, 15773, "GENE"], [15836, 15839, "GENE"]], [[15889, 15892, "GENE"], [15946, 15949, "GENE"], [15966, 15981, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], [[5966, 5971, 6061, 6067, "pathological role"]], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [[5966, 5971, 6061, 6067, 5988, 6005]], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [["HDAC3", "cancer", "regulatory factor"]], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], "sentences": ["\nDelphinidin induces apoptosis in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells\nDelphinidin, the major anthocyanidin compound in pigmented fruits and vegetables, possesses a diphenylpropane-based, polyphenolic-ring structure and has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-angiogenic activity (Figure  1A ). Previously published reports also suggest that treatment of prostate cancer cells with delphinidin results in an efficient, dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. Hafeez et al. (2008) of the University of Wisconsin observed that whereas delphinidin exerts a differential dose response effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells, it did not affect the viability of normal prostate epithelial cells [ 6 ].\nTo examine the mechanism of delphinidin-induced apoptosis, we first examined the cytotoxic effect of delphinidin on human prostate cancer cells using a cell viability assay. Delphinidin did not affect the viability of Du145 or PC3 cells at any of the used concentrations, whereas it had a clear dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on LNCaP cells. (Figure  1B ).\nIn order to confirm that the aforementioned changes in viability were a result of delphinidin-induced apoptosis, we microscopically observed and applied the TUNEL assay on prostate cancer cell lines after a 12-hour treatment with 100-\u03bcM delphinidin. As shown in Figure  1C , delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells displayed changes in morphology that relate to apoptosis, whereas Du145 and PC3 cells did not exhibit similar changes in cellular morphology. The TUNEL assay can be used to detect dead or dying cells exhibiting DNA fragmentation, which is a sign of apoptosis. After delphinidin-treated cells were stained, the dead cells were measured in a multiplex microplate reader (Figure  1D ). As seen in Figure  1D , treatment of LNCaP cells with delphinidin resulted in the appearance of labeled dead cells. In contrast, no stained cells were detected in delphinidin-treated Du145 and PC3 cultures. Therefore, both the morphological observations and the TUNEL assay results indicate that delphinidin induces apoptosis of LNCaP cells. The fact that LNCaP cells are wt-p53 positive, while the two unaffected cancer cell lines, Du145 or PC3, do not express functional p53, suggests that delphinidin induces apoptosis in a p53-dependent fashion.\nDelphinidin induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in LNCaP cells\nCaspases play a major role in cancer cell apoptosis. Caspases-8 and-9 directly or indirectly activate the effector caspases-3 and -7, which serve as key factors in the apoptosis signaling pathway [ 23 ]. To investigate the mechanism of delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, we examined the activation of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9, as well as the cleavage of PARP-1 in the cytosol. PARP-1 is a substrate of effector caspases, so the presence or absence of the cleaved form is a clear indication of whether or not caspases play an essential role in delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells. Prostate cancer cells were incubated with various concentrations of delphinidin (50, 100, and 150 mM) for 24 h, while non-treated cells served as controls. In LNCaP cells, delphinidin treatment led to an increase in the expression of caspases-8 and to higher levels of the cleaved forms of caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP-1, whereas no changes were observed in Du145 and PC3 cells (Figure  2A ). These results clearly suggest that the delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells was initiated by caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 cleaved caspases-3 and -7 activating them. Truly, our experiments showed that delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells was accompanied by a significant increase in caspase activity (Figure  2B ). In turn, the activated effector caspases cleaved their substrate, PARP-1. As a whole, our results suggest that delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCap is mediated by caspase activation.", "\nTo confirm the role of the caspase cascade in the delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells, we tried to inhibit apoptosis by blocking caspase activation with a general caspase inhibitor (zVAD). LNCaP cells were incubated with 100 \u03bcM delphinidin for 24 h, in the presence or absence of zVAD. As shown in Figure  2C , caspase activation in delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells was inhibited by zVAD treatment. We proceeded to examine the effect of zVAD, as well as the effect of a specific inhibitor of caspases-3 and -7, zDQMD, on the delphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells. The caspase-3/-7 activity analysis showed that the delphinidin-induced activation of these two caspases was significantly inhibited by zDQMD (Figure  2D ). To evaluate whether the inhibition of caspases-3 and -7 decreases the cytotoxicity that is caused by delphinidin treatment, we performed another viability assay. The inhibitor effectively blocked caspase activity and reduced cytotoxicity. Therefore, the inactivation of caspases by zVAD or zDQMD dramatically inhibits delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells (Figure  2E ). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that delphinidin promotes apoptosis in these cells by activating the effector caspases-3 and -7.\nDelphinidin antagonizes HDAC3 activity and increases the cytotoxicity of LNCaP cells\nHistone modifications regulate the activation and stabilization of histones and non-histone proteins. HATs and HDACs dynamically regulate chromatin remodeling, histone modification, and gene expression. The main function of HDACs is the repression of gene transcription via deacetylation of lysine residues in histones or non-histones [ 24 ]. HDAC3 is known to regulate the transcription of genes through its effect on chromatin conformation [ 25 ,  26 ], and its functions have been demonstrated in many research studies. Recently, we reported the existence of three novel HDAC3-interacting partners, L3MBTL1, CREB3, and PDCD5, and described roles of HDAC3 in epigenetic regulation mediated by these proteins [ 27 ]. It is our belief that HDAC3 is an important regulatory factor of proliferation, growth homeostasis, and apoptosis of cancer cells during various cellular events.\nTo determine whether the mechanism through which delphinidin induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells includes downregulation of HDAC3 activity; we measured total HDAC activity in cells treated with delphinidin. HDAC activity was decreased by delphinidin in both PC3 cells and LNCaP cells. However, the reduction was much greater in LNCaP cells. (Figure  3A ). We then examined whether delphinidin is a global or a specific HDAC inhibitor. As seen in Figure  3B , delphinidin reduced the activity of HDAC3 activity to a greater extent compared to the activity of the other class I HDACs. We concluded that delphinidin induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells via the specific inhibition of HDAC3 activity. To examine the mechanism through which the reduction of HDAC3 activity takes place, we determined the protein levels of class I HDACs and PARP-1 in delphinidin-treated cancer cells using western blot analysis. As shown in Figure  3C , delphinidin treatment dramatically reduced HDAC3 expression and induced PARP-1 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that delphinidin induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells through the suppression of HDAC3 expression and deacetylase activity. To confirm that the suppression of HDAC activity leads to apoptosis, we examined the viability of LNCaP cells that were incubated with 100 \u03bcM delphinidin alone, or together with either TSA, a general HDAC inhibitor, or MS-275, a specific HDAC1/3 inhibitor. As expected, in both cases of co-treatment the viability of LNCaP cells was lower compared to the viability of cells treated with delphinidin alone. We also examined whether knocking down HDAC3 using siRNA enhanced the apoptotic effect of delphinidin in LNCaP cells. As shown in Figure  3D , HDAC3-knocked down cells treated with delphinidi", "n displayed a significantly lower viability compared to normally expressing HDAC3 cells treated with delphinidin alone or co-treated with delphinidin and HDAC inhibitors. Thus, HDAC3 RNAi-mediated knockdown can enhance the apoptotic effect of delphinidin on LNCaP cells. Taken together, our findings reveal that HDAC3 is a critical factor in delphinidin-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.\nDelphinidin-induced HDAC3 cleavage leads to p53 acetylation in LNCaP cells\nVarious studies have reported that LNCaP cells harbor two functional alleles encoding wild-type p53, whereas DU145 cells express a modified p53 protein with two point mutations (Phe223Leu and Val274Phe) and PC3 cells are deficient in functional p53 protein production. To further support the finding that delphinidin-induced apoptosis is mediated by a downregulation of HDAC3 expression and activity, we examined the effects of different concentrations of delphinidin on p53 acetylation. According to previous reports [ 28 ,  29 ], HDAC3 is cleaved because of sorbitol-induced caspase-7 activation, or during FasL-mediated apoptosis. As p53 is one of the targets of the deacetylases activity of HDAC3, the cleavage of HDAC3 during apoptosis results in an increase in p53 acetylation, whereas the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes is activated. Based on these reports, we proceeded to examine whether an increase in p53 acetylation due to HDAC3 cleavage is also taking place in delphinidin-induced apoptosis. LNCaP cells and DU145 cells treated with delphinidin (50 and 100 mM), as well as untreated controls, were examined using western blot analysis. The apoptotic effect of delphinidin in LNCaP cells was accompanied by cleavage of both PARP-1 and HDAC3 (Figure  4A ). The cleaved form of HDAC3 can be detected using an anti-HDAC3 antibody raised against the N-terminal region of anti-HDAC3, whereas antibodies recognizing the C-terminal region are not able to bind to cleaved HDAC3.\nWe then determined whether p53 acetylation and stability were enhanced by HDAC3 cleavage during delphinidin-induced apoptosis. LNCaP cells were treated with different doses of delphinidin for 24 h. As shown in Figure  4B , delphinidin increased p53 acetylation and stability, whereas HDAC3 was cleaved by activated caspase-7 in delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells, in which apoptosis was induced. We also examined the effect of two other anthocyanidins, cyanidin and aurantinidin, on the p53 acetylation status. As shown in Figure  4C , delphinidin increased p53 acetylation and stability to a greater extent compared to that by cyanidin and aurantinidin.\nTo demonstrate that endogenous p53 is stabilized for activation in response to delphinidin, p53 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of LNCaP cells treated with delphinidin and/or glutaraldehyde (a protein-protein crossinker). Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C and detected by western blot analysis using an anti-p53 antibody. These results show that the stabilization and activation of p53 were induced by enhancing the oligomerization of p53 (Figure  4D ), whereas it is known that oligomerization of p53 is essential for enhancing p53 activity for DNA binding, protein-protein interactions, post-translational modification, and stabilization [ 30 ]. As a whole, these findings suggest that delphinidin induced p53-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP cells through p53 oligomerization.\nDelphinidin-induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells is mediated by activation of p53 and inactivation of HDAC3\nAccording to recent reports, p53-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells is regulated by post-translational modification of p53, including acetylation. Therefore, we examined the results of knocking down HDAC1 or HDAC3 on the stability of p53, on the p53 acetylation levels, as well as on the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins p21 and BAX (which is regulated by p53), in delphinidin-treated LNCaP cells. Treatment of LNCaP cells with delphinidin and si-HDAC1 or si-HDAC3", " increased total p53 and acetylated-p53 protein levels, as well as the expression of p21 and BAX proteins, whereas the increase was greater when HDAC3 was knocked down (Figure  5A ). We also performed a cell viability assay, where treatment of LNCaP cells with si-HDAC3 and delphinidin led to increased cytotoxicity. We conclude that HDAC3 inhibition enhances the apoptotic effect of delphinidin in LNCaP cells.\nTo demonstrate that endogenous p53 undergoes oligomerization in delphinidin-treated cells, p53 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of LNCaP cells treated with delphinidin and/or si-HDAC3, and visualized using western blot analysis. As seen in Figure  5C , p53 oligomerization was increased in delphinidin-treated LNCaP HDAC3 knockdown cells, compared to the delphinidin-treated cells whose HDAC3 expression had not been reduced by si-RNA treatment. We conclude that HDAC3 is directly involved in p53-dependent apoptosis. To further study the effect of HDAC3 on p53 stability in the presence of delphinidin, we overexpressed Flag-fused proteins containing wild-type HDAC3, or a point-mutation of the protein (HDAC3 D309A ), or a C-terminal deletion mutant (HDAC3 DeltaC ). Overexpression of wild-type HDAC3 and HDAC3 D309A  inhibited the ability of delphinidin to induce acetylation and stabilization of p53. The expression of p21 and BAX proteins was reduced (Figure  5D ) and the cells became resistant to delphinidin-induced cytotoxicity (Figure  5E ). In contrast, overexpression of HDAC3 DeltaC  did not inhibit the effects of delphinidin on p53 levels, p53 acetylation, p21 and BAX expression, or cytotoxicity (Figure  5D, Figure 5E ). We next examined whether the p53 oligomerization caused by delphinidin is negatively regulated by HDAC3. As shown in Figure  5F , HDAC3 overexpression is able to inhibit the oligomerization of p53 in delphinine-treated LNCaP cells.\nDelphinidin-induced HDAC3 downregulation leads LNCaP cells to apoptosis via the activation of p53 target genes\nRecent studies have demonstrated that the cleavage of HDAC3 in the apoptotic signaling pathway enhances the expression of p53-regulated pro-apoptotic genes [ 22 ,  29 ]. To examine the activation of the transcription of p53 target genes because of delphinidin treatment, we created reporter plasmids consisting of the promoters of three genes,  p21 ,  Bax , and  Noxa , and the coding sequence of luciferase. The promoters of these three genes contain p53 binding elements and are activated by p53. We transiently transfected LNCaP cells with the reporter plasmids and treated the cells with delphinidin for 24 h. As shown in Figure  6A , delphinidin treatment led to the activation of all three promoters. We conclude that delphinidin-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells is accompanied by the transcriptional activation of p53-upregulated pro-apoptotic genes. We next examined the role of HDAC3 in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. HDAC3 knockdown dramatically enhanced the expression of  p53  and the pro-apoptotic genes  Bax ,  p21 ,  Puma , and  Noxa . HDAC1 knockdown did not have a similar effect on the expression of these genes (Figure  6B ). We also performed experiments where wild-type and mutant forms of HDAC3 were overexpressed. As shown in Figure  6C , overexpressing of HDAC3 wt  and HDAC3 D391A  suppressed the delphinidin-induced transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, whereas HDAC3 DeltaC  did not affect the transcription of these genes. Therefore, our results demonstrate that HDAC3 is cleaved by effector-caspases in response to delphinidin-initiated cell death signaling, resulting in the transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic target genes, including  Puma ,  Bax , and  Noxa . As shown in Figure  6D , delphinidin treatment of LNCaP cells results in activation of effector caspases, whereas activated caspase-3 cleaves HDAC3. These results suggest that HDAC3 cleavage leads to the hyperacetylation and oligomerization of p53, as well as to the transcriptional activati", "on of p53 target genes during delphinidin-induced apoptosis in p53 wild-type human prostate cancer cells.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "5302952_INTRODUCTION", "text": ["\nProstate cancer is one the most widespread types of cancer. Until recently, it was the most common cancer among men in Western countries, whereas its incidence is increasing in Asian populations. In the United States alone, 186,320 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed and a total of 28,660 deaths are predicted [ 1 ]. Prostate cancer is a slowly growing cancer and is usually detected at a late stage [ 2 ]. Most patients exhibit increased levels of specific cancer markers, such as the prostate specific antigen (PSA) which is secreted into blood circulation [ 3 ]. Because prostate cancer is initially androgen-dependent, androgen deprivation is commonly used to cause it to regress [ 4 ]. However, prostate cancers that are not cured by surgery eventually become androgen independent, thus resistant to anti-androgen therapy, and progress to highly aggressive metastatic cancer often leading to a patient's death [ 5 ]. Moreover, standard chemotherapy is rather ineffective for prostate cancer and has serious side effects due to its toxicity.\nAn alternative approach is the use of natural dietary compounds for either chemoprevention or chemotherapy. Two examples are resveratrol and EGCG, found in red wine and green tea, respectively. These have been demonstrated to be beneficial agents as they interfere with key processes involved in cancer development and progression. Among polyphenols, a promising dietary component is delphinidin (Figure  1A ), one of the main anthocyanidins. Delphinidin is a diphenylpropane-based, polyphenolic ring structure-harboring compound that is naturally found in pomegranates, berries, grapes, beets, and eggplants [ 6 ]. Delphinidin possesses anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic properties. Recently published reports showed that it is able to inhibit the invasion of breast cancer cells [ 7 ]. Due to the factors mentioned above (emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, low efficiency and serious side effects of classic chemotherapy against this type of cancer), dietary chemoprevention and dietary therapy of prostate cancer are increasingly considered as a promising means to reduce the occurrence of this type of cancer, or reduce the side effects during its treatment, respectively [ 8 ,  9 ].\nHistone deacetylases (HDACs) are widely expressed, highly conserved proteins. Eighteen human HDACs have been identified, which are grouped into four classes based on their homology to their respective yeast orthologs. Class I HDACs (1, 2, 3, and 8) are homologous to the yeast transcriptional regulator RPD3, class II HDACs (HDAC 4-7, 9, 10) are similar to Hda1, and class III HDACs (SIRTs 1-7) are NAD + -dependent histone deacetylases homologous Sir2 [ 10 ]. HDAC11 is quite different from the members of the other classes and has been placed in a fourth class. In addition to histone proteins, HDACs have many non-histone protein substrates, including p53, NF-kB, and STAT, which are important transcription factors regulating the expression of a large number of genes [ 11 ]. HDACs are involved in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, gene repression, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis in various cells [ 12 ]. However, the roles of the various HDACs in cell proliferation and cell death are not yet fully established.\nHDACs are important therapeutic targets in various human cancers, because they regulate the expression of p53 and its activation [ 13 - 16 ]. The p53 protein is a key transcription factor of tumor cell death signaling pathways as it regulates the expression of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [ 17 ,  18 ]. Another protein, MDM2, binds and ubiquinates p53, resulting in the rapid degradation of the latter. However, acetylation of p53 by two histone acetyltransferases (HATs), p300 and CBP, abrogates the ability of mdm2 to bind and ubiquinate p53, leading to p53 stabilization [ 19 ,  20 ]. As expected, deacetylation of p53 by HDACs has the opposite effect, i.e., it promotes its degradation. Among HDACs, HDAC3 localizes to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane. It is functionally distinct from other members of Class I HDACs [ 21 ] and exerts an important regulatory effect on the expression and function of p53. According to recent research, the cleavage of HDAC3 that takes place during apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents, leads to the expression of p53-regulated pro-apoptotic genes [ 22 ].\nIn this study, we demonstrate that delphinidin induces apoptosis in prostate LNCaP cancer cells by inducing caspase-mediated HDAC3 cleavage that results in the acetylation and stabilization of p53. The activation of effector caspases during delphinidin-induced apoptosis is involved in the cleavage and inactivation of HDAC3, whereas the downregulation of HDAC3 activity leads to the oligomerization of p53 in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Moreover, delphinidin-induced apoptosis is accompanied by the upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes such as  Bax  and  p21 . To sum up, we demonstrated that treatment of LNCaP cells with delphinidin significantly enhanced p53 stabilization and p53 acetylation. Delphinidin appears to serve as a multifunctional anti-tumor and HDAC-inhibition agent in various types of human cancer.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 16, "DISEASE"], [53, 59, "DISEASE"], [100, 106, "DISEASE"], [246, 261, "DISEASE"], [330, 345, "DISEASE"], [471, 477, "DISEASE"], [587, 602, "DISEASE"], [713, 728, "DISEASE"], [993, 1008, "DISEASE"], [1702, 1708, "DISEASE"], [1838, 1851, "DISEASE"], [1935, 1950, "DISEASE"], [2043, 2049, "DISEASE"], [2205, 2211, "DISEASE"], [2590, 2594, "GENE"], [2735, 2739, "GENE"], [2748, 2754, "GENE"], [2942, 2945, "GENE"], [2947, 2952, "GENE"], [3375, 3381, "DISEASE"], [3424, 3427, "GENE"], [3660, 3664, "GENE"], [3688, 3691, "GENE"], [3767, 3770, "GENE"], [3813, 3817, "GENE"], [3822, 3825, "GENE"], [3852, 3856, "GENE"], [3880, 3883, "GENE"], [3896, 3899, "GENE"], [3958, 3961, "GENE"]], [[4044, 4049, "GENE"], [4409, 4412, "GENE"], [4534, 4540, "DISEASE"], [4576, 4581, "GENE"], [4644, 4647, "GENE"], [4770, 4775, "GENE"], [4789, 4803, "RELATION"], [4807, 4812, "GENE"], [4854, 4857, "GENE"], [4867, 4882, "DISEASE"], [5003, 5006, "GENE"], [5013, 5016, "GENE"], [5116, 5119, "GENE"], [5138, 5141, "GENE"], [5268, 5274, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], [[4807, 4812, 4867, 4882, "decreased expression"]]], "triplets": [[], [[4807, 4812, 4867, 4882, 4789, 4803]]], "triplets_text": [[], [["HDAC3", "prostate cancer", "downregulation"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nProstate cancer is one the most widespread types of cancer.

Recently, a worldwide pharmaceutical company started to develop novel plant-based natural compounds for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer [ 6 ,  31 ].\nAnthocyanidins are flavonoid polyphenols that are abundant in fruits and vegetables [ 32 ]. Several published studies have demonstrated the potential of flavonoids as anti-tumor chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents. Flavonoids have also been associated with beneficial effects in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis, and various microvascular diseases, which are attributed to their potential anti-inflammatory properties [ 32 ]. Delphinidin is an anthocyanidins with potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. It may aid in the development of mechanism-based cancer-prevention approaches [ 33 ].\nIn this study, we demonstrated the chemotherapeutic effects of delphinidin by studying its pro-apoptotic effect on human prostate cancer cells. Treatment of LNCaP cells with delphinidin reduced cell viability (Figure  1 ) by inducing apoptosis (Figure  2 ). Delphinidin treatment led to the activation of initiator caspases and effector caspases, and resulted in the cleavage of PARP-1 and HDAC3 in LNCaP cells (Figure  3 ), as well as in a significant increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, PUMA, and p21 (Figure  6 ). Our results also show that the stability of p53 determines the fate of cancer cells in patients being treated with delphinidin or with a combination of delphinidin and other agents.\nHDACs are transcriptional co-repressors that regulate cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, and apoptosis in cancer cell lines [ 34 ]. Inhibition of HDACs has been shown to enhance tumorigenesis in a variety of cancer cell types [ 35 ]. Clinical trials of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of both hematopoietic and solid tumors are currently underway [ 36 ]. HDACs have a physiological role in the maintenance of cell proliferation, cell survival, and the suppression of intestinal and epithelial cell maturation. Therefore, treatment with HDAC inhibitors induces growth arrest, maturation, and apoptosis of cancer cell lines. Among HDACs, HDAC1 and HDAC2 have been demonstrated to play a role in repressing intestinal cell maturation and promoting cell proliferation and survival [ 37 ,  38 ]. In this study, we investigated the role of HDAC3 in cell survival and apoptosis; we observed increased apoptotic rates in HDAC3 knockdown LNCaP cells treated with delphinidin. We also demonstrated that HDAC3 cleavage in delphinidin-induced apoptosis results in the p53-dependent activation of the expression of  p21  and  Bax , whereas overexpression of HDAC3 significantly reduced the delphinidin-induced activation of the  p21, Bax , and  Noxa  promoters. Conversely, knockdown of HDAC3 enhanced the activating effect of delphinidin on these promoters. Moreover, HDAC3 cleavage reduced cell growth and cell survival, and mediated the dose-dependent apoptotic effect of delphinidin.\nThe p53 protein is very important for the regulation of viability and genomic stability of cancer cells [ 39 ], because it activates major pro-apoptotic genes; therefore, mutations of p53 have been reported in a variety of human cancers. The ability of p53 to exert its function is efficiently regulated by specific modifications, cellular localization, and cell-cycle phase [ 40 ]. Acetylation of lysine residues in the p53 C-terminus has been shown to block its interaction with MDM2, inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, acetylation of p53 is a key regulatory factor for p53 stability and activity during cancer cell apoptosis. Acetylation of p53 takes place at specific lysine residues and is carried out by acetyltransferases such as p300 and CBP. The status of acetylated p53 is known to be regulated by various HDACs [ 41 ]. Indeed, deacetylation of p53 by HDAC3 is required for repressing the hyperacetylation of p53 during the apoptosis of cancer cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that the inactivation of HDAC3 increases the levels of p53 acetylation, its stability and causes its oligomerization, leading to apoptosis. Our data suggests that delphinidin treatment leads to caspase-mediated HDAC3 cleavage, resulting in the hyperacetylation of p53.\nTo sum up, we investigated the apoptotic effect of delphinidin on prostate cancer cells and demonstrated that the delphinidin-induced apoptosis is achieved through the activation of p53. Caspases have been shown to be involved in the induction of apoptosis by delphinidin. Indeed, our results show that the inactivation and cleavage of HDAC3 is a result of the activation of effector caspases. We also ascertained that delphinidin-induced apoptosis could be blocked by inhibiting HDAC3 cleavage with specific caspase-3/-7 inhibitors. Our results strongly suggest that delphinidin, as well as other HDAC inhibitors, should be considered as potential agents for the treatment of human prostate cancer.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 16, "DISEASE"], [51, 57, "DISEASE"], [257, 272, "DISEASE"], [590, 610, "DISEASE"], [612, 627, "DISEASE"], [829, 835, "DISEASE"], [897, 903, "DISEASE"], [1055, 1070, "DISEASE"], [1313, 1319, "GENE"], [1324, 1329, "GENE"], [1444, 1447, "GENE"], [1449, 1453, "GENE"], [1459, 1462, "GENE"], [1521, 1524, "GENE"], [1548, 1554, "DISEASE"], [1771, 1777, "DISEASE"], [1873, 1879, "DISEASE"], [2271, 2277, "DISEASE"], [2303, 2308, "GENE"], [2313, 2318, "GENE"], [2501, 2506, "GENE"], [2580, 2585, "GENE"], [2660, 2665, "GENE"], [2723, 2726, "GENE"], [2770, 2773, "GENE"], [2780, 2783, "GENE"], [2812, 2817, "GENE"], [2883, 2886, "GENE"], [2888, 2891, "GENE"], [2899, 2903, "GENE"], [2941, 2946, "GENE"], [3023, 3028, "GENE"], [3146, 3149, "GENE"], [3184, 3194, "RELATION"], [3233, 3239, "DISEASE"], [3313, 3322, "RELATION"], [3326, 3329, "GENE"], [3371, 3377, "DISEASE"], [3395, 3398, "GENE"], [3702, 3705, "GENE"], [3711, 3732, "RELATION"], [3737, 3740, "GENE"], [3771, 3777, "DISEASE"], [3809, 3812, "GENE"], [3902, 3906, "GENE"], [3911, 3914, "GENE"], [3941, 3944, "GENE"]], [[4020, 4023, "GENE"], [4027, 4032, "GENE"], [4112, 4118, "DISEASE"], [4187, 4192, "GENE"], [4217, 4220, "GENE"], [4373, 4378, "GENE"], [4426, 4429, "GENE"], [4497, 4512, "DISEASE"], [4578, 4609, "RELATION"], [4613, 4616, "GENE"], [4767, 4772, "GENE"], [4911, 4916, "GENE"], [5114, 5129, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[3146, 3149, 3233, 3239, "pathological role"], [3326, 3329, 3371, 3377, "associated mutation"], [3702, 3705, 3771, 3777, "pathological role"]], [[4613, 4616, 4497, 4512, "causative activation"]]], "triplets": [[[3146, 3149, 3233, 3239, 3184, 3194], [3326, 3329, 3371, 3377, 3313, 3322], [3702, 3705, 3771, 3777, 3711, 3732]], [[4613, 4616, 4497, 4512, 4578, 4609]]], "triplets_text": [[["p53", "cancer", "regulation"], ["p53", "cancer", "mutations"], ["p53", "cancer", "key regulatory factor"]], [["p53", "prostate cancer", "achieved through the activation"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nProstate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men worldwide and its incidence is continuously increasing.

To now determine the role of SMOX in another infectious model of the gastrointestinal tract, we infected WT and  -/- Smox  mice with  C. rodentium , the rodent equivalent of enteropathogenic  Escherichia coli  that causes colitis in mice ( 7 ,  26 ).  C. rodentium  colonization of the colon and levels in the feces were not affected by the deletion of  Smox  (Figure  1 A; Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). When infected with  C. rodentium , WT mice did not increase their weight to the same degree as uninfected animals (Figure  1 B); by contrast, infected  -/- Smox  mice gained weight as uninfected mice, and there was a significant difference between the body weight of infected WT and infected  Smox- deficient mice at day 8 and 10 post-infection (Figure  1 B). Moreover, colon weight-to-length ratio, an indicator of inflammation that was increased in infected animals, was significantly attenuated by 59.3 \u00b1 3.8% in infected  -/- Smox  mice compared with infected WT mice (Figure  1 C). H&E staining of the colons of  C. rodentium -infected WT mice demonstrated an effacement of the brush border, hyperplasia, severe mucosal inflammation, and submucosal edema (Figure  1 D). However, the histologic damage was markedly attenuated in infected  -/- Smox  mice (Figure  1 D). Using a comprehensive scoring system to quantify the degree of inflammation and epithelial damage ( 25 ,  26 ), we found a significant reduction in histologic injury in  -/- Smox  mice compared with WT animals (Figure  1 E). There was no detectable inflammation or epithelial injury in uninfected  -/- Smox  or WT mice (Figure  1 D).\n  Deletion Exacerbates Colitis in the DSS Model\nWe next treated WT and  -/- Smox  mice with DSS to assess the role of SMOX in a second model of experimental colitis. We used a model of injury and recovery, caused by this epithelial-damaging agent ( 28 ,  29 ). Surprisingly, we observed profound mortality beginning on day 6 of the 10-day protocol in the  -/- Smox  mice, which was not observed in DSS-treated WT animals (Figure  2 A). Contrary to the  C. rodentium  model, the weight-to-length ratio of the colon was increased in  -/- Smox  mice compared with WT mice treated with DSS (Figure  2 B). WT and  -/- Smox  mice began losing weight on day 6 and day 4 after starting DSS, respectively (Figure  2 C). However, in accordance with the increased mortality,  -/- Smox  mice lost more body weight than WT mice (Figure  2 C). Moreover, we observed increased overall histological injury in DSS-treated  -/- Smox  mice compared with WT mice with DSS colitis, with increased colonic inflammation, epithelial damage/crypt loss, and crypt abscesses (Figures  2 D,E).\nThe Deletion of  Smox  Affects the Mucosal Immune Response During Colitis\nTo further assess the role of SMOX on the immune response during colitis, we analyzed the synthesis of mediators of the inflammatory response in the colonic mucosa. As shown in Table S1 in Supplementary Material and Figure  3 A, the infection of WT mice with  C. rodentium  led to an increased production of the innate cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CSF3 (also known as G-CSF), as well as the prototype Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma, and the Th17 cytokine IL-17. Each of these cytokines was less abundant in the colons of  C. rodentium -infected  -/- Smox  mice compared with infected WT animals (Figure  3 A). Similarly, the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL10 were significantly increased in the colon of  C. rodentium -infected WT mice compared with uninfected animals (Table S1 in Supplementary Material); these chemokines were not significantly increased in the mucosa of  Smox -deficient mice during the infection and were decreased from the levels in the WT mice (Table S1 in Supplementary Material).\nIL-6, CSF3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17 were also induced in the colon of DSS-treated WT mice compared to untreated animals (Figure  3 B); the levels of induction were comparable to those observed in  C. rodentium  colitis (Figure  3 A). However, IFN-gamma was not increased in the colonic mucosa in DSS-induced colitis (Figure  3 B). Notably, the effectors induced with DSS treatment, except TNF-\u03b1, were further increased in  Smox -deficient mice that were treated with DSS (Figure  3 B). The level of IFN-gamma in the colon was not modulated in animals with  Smox  deletion (Figure  3 B). Only the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL1 were significantly more abundant in the colon of DSS-treated animals, and there was no difference between WT and  -/- Smox  mice (Table S2 in Supplementary Material).\nSpermidine and Spermine Concentrations Are Regulated by SMOX in Colitis\nTo further understand the role of SMOX, we analyzed the effect of  Smox  deletion on polyamine concentrations in the colon during  C. rodentium  and DSS-induced colitis. First, we found that  Smox  mRNA expression was significantly induced by 2.25 \u00b1 0.35-fold in the colon of WT animals treated with DSS compared with untreated mice (Figure  4 A); however,  Smox  upregulation was not observed during  C. rodentium  infection (Figure  4 A). The deletion of  Smox  was associated with a complete elimination of  Smox  gene expression in the mouse colons in all of the na\u00efve and colitis conditions (Figure  4 A). The colonic levels of putrescine were higher in both WT and  Smox -deficient mice infected with  C. rodentium  or treated with DSS compared with control animals, and there was no significant difference between WT and  -/- Smox  mice (Figure  4 B). Spermidine concentration was also increased in both  C. rodentium  and DSS colitis tissues (Figure  4 C). Notably, spermidine levels were significantly reduced by 31 and 54% in  -/- Smox  mice during  C. rodentium  infection and DSS treatment, respectively (Figure  4 C). We did not observe an increase of spermine concentration in the colon of mice with either form of colitis, but there was more spermine in  Smox -deficient mice than in WT animals in the  C. rodentium  model (Figure  4 D). There was a modest increase in spermine in  Smox -deficient mice treated with DSS, which did not reach statistical significance. Finally, the spermidine/spermine ratio was significantly increased in  C. rodentium -infected or DSS-treated WT mice when compared with controls (Figure  4 E). This ratio was significantly reduced in  -/- Smox  mice that were uninfected/untreated, infected with  C. rodentium , or treated with DSS compared with WT animals (Figure  4 D). These results indicate that polyamine synthesis and metabolism is enhanced during colitis and that deletion of  Smox  mainly leads to a diminution of spermidine concentration in the colon, which can likely be attributed to reduced back conversion of spermine to spermidine.\nTo gain more insight into the role of polyamines in the establishment of  C. rodentium  and DSS colitis, we correlated the histopathology score with the concentration of each polyamine for each WT mouse. In the  C. rodentium  infection model, we found a positive and significant correlation between putrescine, spermidine, and spermine concentration with the injury score (Figure  5 A). In contrast, we found that spermidine level in the colon was inversely correlated with histologic injury score in the DSS model (Figure  5 B); thus, more spermidine is associated with decreased DSS colitis (Figure  5 B). There were no significant associations between the concentration of putrescine or spermine with DSS-mediated injury (Figure  5 B). These data suggest that increased polyamine synthesis is deleterious for  C. rodentium -induced colitis, whereas spermidine protects mice during DSS-induced colitis.\n"], "ner": [[[39, 46, "DISEASE"], [53, 57, "GENE"], [100, 104, "GENE"], [153, 162, "DISEASE"], [219, 223, "GENE"], [307, 311, "GENE"], [412, 419, "DISEASE"], [544, 548, "GENE"], [758, 762, "GENE"], [895, 899, "GENE"], [1132, 1136, "GENE"], [1449, 1453, "GENE"], [1649, 1653, "GENE"], [1777, 1781, "GENE"], [1832, 1839, "DISEASE"], [1885, 1889, "GENE"], [1927, 1931, "GENE"], [1966, 1973, "DISEASE"], [2169, 2173, "GENE"], [2345, 2349, "GENE"], [2422, 2426, "GENE"], [2578, 2582, "GENE"], [2719, 2723, "GENE"], [2761, 2768, "DISEASE"], [2892, 2896, "GENE"], [2941, 2948, "DISEASE"], [2979, 2983, "GENE"], [3014, 3021, "DISEASE"], [3278, 3282, "GENE"], [3284, 3289, "GENE"], [3295, 3299, "GENE"], [3315, 3320, "GENE"], [3361, 3370, "GENE"], [3394, 3399, "GENE"], [3489, 3493, "GENE"], [3575, 3579, "GENE"], [3581, 3585, "GENE"], [3587, 3591, "GENE"], [3593, 3598, "GENE"], [3600, 3605, "GENE"], [3611, 3617, "GENE"], [3834, 3838, "GENE"], [3964, 3968, "GENE"], [3970, 3974, "GENE"], [3976, 3981, "GENE"], [3987, 3992, "GENE"]], [[4168, 4175, "DISEASE"], [4200, 4209, "GENE"], [4265, 4272, "DISEASE"], [4346, 4351, "GENE"], [4380, 4384, "GENE"], [4456, 4465, "GENE"], [4514, 4518, "GENE"], [4564, 4568, "GENE"], [4573, 4578, "GENE"], [4697, 4701, "GENE"], [4802, 4806, "GENE"], [4810, 4817, "DISEASE"], [4852, 4856, "GENE"], [4885, 4889, "GENE"], [4979, 4986, "DISEASE"], [5010, 5014, "GENE"], [5176, 5180, "GENE"], [5276, 5280, "GENE"], [5329, 5333, "GENE"], [5395, 5402, "DISEASE"], [5490, 5494, "GENE"], [5651, 5655, "GENE"], [5752, 5759, "DISEASE"], [5859, 5863, "GENE"], [6047, 6054, "DISEASE"], [6088, 6092, "GENE"], [6215, 6219, "GENE"], [6505, 6509, "GENE"], [6720, 6727, "DISEASE"], [6750, 6754, "GENE"], [7008, 7015, "DISEASE"], [7497, 7504, "DISEASE"], [7747, 7754, "DISEASE"], [7808, 7815, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], []], "triplets": [[], []], "triplets_text": [[], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nAttenuation of  C. rodentium -Induced Colitis with  Smox  Deletion\nWe previously reported that the SMOX inhibitor MDL 72527 reduces  H. pylori -induced gastritis and carcinogenesis ( 19 ).

WT and  -/- Smox  mice began losing weight on day 6 and day 4 after starting DSS, respectively (Figure  2 C). However, in accordance with the increased mortality,  -/- Smox  mice lost more body weight than WT mice (Figure  2 C). Moreover, we observed increased overall histological injury in DSS-treated  -/- Smox  mice compared with WT mice with DSS colitis, with increased colonic inflammation, epithelial damage/crypt loss, and crypt abscesses (Figures  2 D,E).\nThe Deletion of  Smox  Affects the Mucosal Immune Response During Colitis\nTo further assess the role of SMOX on the immune response during colitis, we analyzed the synthesis of mediators of the inflammatory response in the colonic mucosa. As shown in Table S1 in Supplementary Material and Figure  3 A, the infection of WT mice with  C. rodentium  led to an increased production of the innate cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CSF3 (also known as G-CSF), as well as the prototype Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma, and the Th17 cytokine IL-17. Each of these cytokines was less abundant in the colons of  C. rodentium -infected  -/- Smox  mice compared with infected WT animals (Figure  3 A). Similarly, the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL10 were significantly increased in the colon of  C. rodentium -infected WT mice compared with uninfected animals (Table S1 in Supplementary Material); these chemokines were not significantly increased in the mucosa of  Smox -deficient mice during the infection and were decreased from the levels in the WT mice (Table S1 in Supplementary Material).\nIL-6, CSF3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17 were al", "so induced in the colon of DSS-treated WT mice compared to untreated animals (Figure  3 B); the levels of induction were comparable to those observed in  C. rodentium  colitis (Figure  3 A). However, IFN-gamma was not increased in the colonic mucosa in DSS-induced colitis (Figure  3 B). Notably, the effectors induced with DSS treatment, except TNF-\u03b1, were further increased in  Smox -deficient mice that were treated with DSS (Figure  3 B). The level of IFN-gamma in the colon was not modulated in animals with  Smox  deletion (Figure  3 B). Only the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL1 were significantly more abundant in the colon of DSS-treated animals, and there was no difference between WT and  -/- Smox  mice (Table S2 in Supplementary Material).\nSpermidine and Spermine Concentrations Are Regulated by SMOX in Colitis\nTo further understand the role of SMOX, we analyzed the effect of  Smox  deletion on polyamine concentrations in the colon during  C. rodentium  and DSS-induced colitis. First, we found that  Smox  mRNA expression was significantly induced by 2.25 \u00b1 0.35-fold in the colon of WT animals treated with DSS compared with untreated mice (Figure  4 A); however,  Smox  upregulation was not observed during  C. rodentium  infection (Figure  4 A). The deletion of  Smox  was associated with a complete elimination of  Smox  gene expression in the mouse colons in all of the na\u00efve and colitis conditions (Figure  4 A). The colonic levels of putrescine were higher in both WT and  Smox -deficient mice infected with  C. rodentium  or treated with DSS compared with control animals, and there was no significant difference between WT and  -/- Smox  mice (Figure  4 B). Spermidine concentration was also increased in both  C. rodentium  and DSS colitis tissues (Figure  4 C). Notably, spermidine levels were significantly reduced by 31 and 54% in  -/- Smox  mice during  C. rodentium  infection and DSS treatment, respectively (Figure  4 C). We did not observe an increase of spermine concentration in the colon of mice with either form of colitis, but there was more spermine in  Smox -deficient mice than in WT animals in the  C. rodentium  model (Figure  4 D). There was a modest increase in spermine in  Smox -deficient mice treated with DSS, which did not reach statistical significance. Finally, the spermidine/spermine ratio was significantly increased in  C. rodentium -infected or DSS-treated WT mice when compared with controls (Figure  4 E). This ratio was significantly reduced in  -/- Smox  mice that were uninfected/untreated, infected with  C. rodentium , or treated with DSS compared with WT animals (Figure  4 D). These results indicate that polyamine synthesis and metabolism is enhanced during colitis and that deletion of  Smox  mainly leads to a diminution of spermidine concentration in the colon, which can likely be attributed to reduced back conversion of spermine to spermidine.\nTo gain more insight into the role of polyamines in the establishment of  C. rodentium  and DSS colitis, we correlated the histopathology score with the concentration of each polyamine for each WT mouse. In the  C. rodentium  infection model, we found a positive and significant correlation between putrescine, spermidine, and spermine concentration with the injury score (Figure  5 A). In contrast, we found that spermidine level in the colon was inversely correlated with histologic injury score in the DSS model (Figure  5 B); thus, more spermidine is associated with decreased DSS colitis (Figure  5 B). There were no significant associations between the concentration of putrescine or spermine with DSS-mediated injury (Figure  5 B). These data suggest that increased polyamine synthesis is deleterious for  C. rodentium -induced colitis, whereas spermidine protects mice during DSS-induced colitis.\n"]}

The enzyme spermine oxidase (SMOX), which back-converts spermine to spermidine, contributes to regulation of polyamine levels, but can also have other effects.

In addition, we reported that SMOX can be upregulated in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.

In  C. rodentium -infected wild-type (WT) mice, there were marked increases in colon weight/length and histologic injury, with mucosal hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration; these changes were ameliorated in  -/- Smox  mice.

Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine bind both RNA and DNA and are involved in various cellular processes such as maintenance of DNA structure, gene expression, RNA folding and bending, and protein translation ( 1 - 3 ). These three biogenic polyamines are thus essential for cell homeostasis, growth, differentiation, division, and death ( 4 ,  5 ). In addition, polyamines exhibit critical effects during pathological conditions through their potent toxicity at high concentration ( 6 ), regulation of inflammation ( 7 ,  8 ), and modulation of oxidative stress ( 9 ,  10 ). In this context, the homeostasis of polyamine content within a non-toxic range through synthesis, degradation, and transport is a considerable challenge for cells.\nPutrescine, the first polyamine in the anabolic pathway, is generated by ornithine decarboxylation catalyzed by cytosolic ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1, also known as ODC). Putrescine is then sequentially converted into spermidine and spermine  via  the action of spermidine synthase and spermine synthase, respectively ( 5 ). Importantly, the back conversion of spermine to spermidine and putrescine is a critical step in the regulation of polyamine levels, notably to limit the cytotoxic effects of spermine accumulation ( 11 ). This can be achieved by two metabolic pathways: first, the enzyme spermidine/spermine  N (1)-acetyltransferase 1 catalyzes the acetylation of spermine into  N (1)-acetylspermine and spermidine into  N (1)-acetylspermidine; and then, the oxidation of these two products through the enzyme polyamine oxidase leads to the formation of spermidine and putrescine, respectively. However, this pathway is poorly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract during infection and inflammation ( 12 - 14 ).

In accordance with this result, we also found that knockout of  Smox  results in spermidine depletion and spermine accumulation in the colonic mucosa, which is associated with amelioration of  C. rodentium  colitis and worsening of DSS-induced colonic inflammation. Our data also indicate that these two models of colitis are driven by distinct pathological processes that can be potentially manipulated by the regulation of spermidine and spermine concentration.\nOur laboratory has previously reported that SMOX is induced during  H. pylori  infection in macrophages ( 14 ,  31 ) and in gastric epithelial cells ( 9 ,  17 ). This leads to H 2 O 2 -mediated DNA damage ( 9 ,  17 ) and support of chronic inflammation, potentially due to spermine depletion ( 31 ).  C. rodentium  infection leads to the induction of ODC in the colon of mice ( 7 ,  27 ), which has been further underlined in this study by the increase of putrescine concentration in the colonic tissues of infected mice. However, we now observed that  Smox  is not induced in the colon of mice infected with  C. rodentium . The discrepancy between  H. pylori  and  C. rodentium  in their ability to induce SMOX could be explained by the fact that SMOX induction in gastric tissue is dependent on the  H. pylori  virulence factor CagA ( 9 ), which is directly injected into host epithelial cells by a type IV secretion system. We can therefore postulate that  C. rodentium  does not possess the arsenal to stimulate  Smox  mRNA expression despite its numerous virulence factors including type III secretion system-dependent effectors ( 32 ). Contrasting to the  C. rodentium  model, we observed that  Smox  mRNA is upregulated in the colon of mice with DSS colitis. This is consistent with the increase of  SMOX  mRNA levels and SMOX protein expression in inflammatory cells of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) ( 22 ). Similarly, Weiss et al. showed that spermidine was enhanced, and spermine was decreased in colonic epithelial cells of DSS-treated mice compared with untreated animals and in UC patients compared with healthy individuals ( 33 ), which is consistent with increased SMOX activity. Therefore, it would be of interest to determine which signaling pathways are involved in  Smox  mRNA expression during DSS colitis in future studies.\nSpermine oxidase converts spermine into spermidine. Despite the fact that this enzyme was not upregulated in the colon of mice infected with  C. rodentium , we found that  Smox  gene deletion resulted in a decreased concentration of spermidine and an accumulation of spermine in the colon. Similar data were obtained in the DSS model. Importantly, this effect of  Smox  deletion was also observed in uninfected/untreated animals. Altogether, these results support that the constitutive expression of SMOX, which can be augmented under specific conditions, is critical for the maintenance of spermine to spermidine flux in the colon and thus plays a role in the pathophysiology of colitis.\nThe next essential finding highlighted by our study is the dual role of polyamines in our two models of colitis. First, in WT mice infected with  C. rodentium , increasing concentration of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine was significantly correlated with enhanced colonic injury score. Conversely, there was an inverse correlation between the damage to the colon and spermidine concentration in WT mice treated with DSS. These data therefore imply that polyamines are deleterious during  C. rodentium  infection and that spermidine protects animals against DSS-induced colitis. Consistently, we also observed that  Smox  deletion, which results in a reduction of spermidine concentration in the colon, is protective in  C. rodentium  colitis and exacerbates DSS-mediated injury. Although we cannot completely exclude a potential role for putrescine and spermine in the development of  C. rodentium -induced colitis, our data support the contention that spermidine displays opposite effects in mice with intestinal infection with an attaching and effacing pathogen or with epithelial injury-driven colitis.\nThe question raised by our finding is how can the same polyamine have differing effects in the colon depending on the model? Supporting the concept that spermidine protects from DSS colitis, it has been reported that this polyamine exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by dampening MAPKs, PI3K, STAT-1, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in myeloid cells ( 34 - 36 ) and thus gene transcription. Intriguingly, IFN-gamma-induced synthesis of IL-6 is reduced in spermidine-treated THP-1 cells ( 35 ). This occurs through the spermidine-dependent stimulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2a that inhibits IFN-gamma signaling ( 35 ). Consistent with these prior findings, it should be noted that IL-6 was one of the cytokines that we found to be further increased in  -/- Smox  mice during DSS colitis. Moreover, it has been described that daily supplementation of DSS-treated mice with spermidine improves clinical and histological parameters compared with sham-treated animals ( 35 ). In the same way, Yang et al. established that spermidine alleviates inflammation by favoring the polarization of macrophages toward an M2 response in a murine model of multiple sclerosis ( 37 ). The effect of spermidine on  C. rodentium  virulence gene expression is unknown and has not been analyzed in the present study. Intriguingly, it has been reported that spermidine is required for the virulence of  Salmonella enterica  Typhimurium in mice ( 38 ). Therefore, it could be now of interest whether decreased spermidine concentration in the colons of infected  -/- Smox  mice could lead to a reduction of  C. rodentium  virulence, and consequently to less damage without affecting colonization levels. However, the potential role of putrescine and spermine on the pathophysiology of  C. rodentium  infection should be also considered, since the concentration of all three polyamines was significantly correlated with the damage to the colon.\nIn conclusion, our work reveals that the local homeostasis of spermidine and spermine through SMOX is a critical regulator of colonic inflammation. In the DSS model, spermidine is protective and consequently  Smox  deletion worsens colitis. Since SMOX is induced in the colon of UC patients ( 22 ,  33 ), we suggest that its induction could be beneficial by increasing spermidine concentration rather than deleterious by generating H 2 O 2 . Since DSS colitis exhibits some features similar to human UC, such patients might benefit from strategies to increase spermidine concentration in the colon, rather than inhibiting SMOX. Given that spermidine supplementation is safe, may also benefit the cardiovascular system ( 39 ) and exhibits neuroprotective and anti-cancerous properties ( 40 ), the use of this polyamine as a dietary supplement should be taken into consideration for patients with UC. However, our work also underlines that spermidine supplementation most likely should be avoided in the case of gastrointestinal infections, especially those involving attaching and effacing pathogens. Since different foods contain varying amount of spermidine ( 41 ), specific dietary recommendations related to polyamine intake may help in preventing colonic inflammation and/or severe intestinal infection.\n"], "ner": [[[155, 162, "DISEASE"], [218, 225, "DISEASE"], [391, 398, "DISEASE"], [464, 468, "GENE"], [607, 614, "DISEASE"], [714, 721, "DISEASE"], [908, 912, "GENE"], [1417, 1421, "GENE"], [1571, 1575, "GENE"], [1612, 1616, "GENE"], [1881, 1885, "GENE"], [2065, 2069, "GENE"], [2121, 2128, "DISEASE"], [[2158, 2177], [2169, 2188], "RELATION"], [2171, 2175, "GENE"], [2193, 2197, "GENE"], [2256, 2274, "DISEASE"], [2276, 2278, "DISEASE"], [2463, 2465, "DISEASE"], [2552, 2556, "GENE"], [2657, 2661, "GENE"], [2690, 2697, "DISEASE"], [2889, 2893, "GENE"], [3081, 3085, "GENE"], [3217, 3221, "GENE"], [3358, 3393, "RELATION"], [3397, 3404, "DISEASE"], [3510, 3517, "DISEASE"], [3980, 3987, "DISEASE"]], [[4026, 4030, "GENE"], [4145, 4152, "DISEASE"], [4318, 4325, "DISEASE"], [4508, 4515, "DISEASE"], [4699, 4706, "DISEASE"], [4807, 4811, "GENE"], [4813, 4819, "GENE"], [4825, 4830, "GENE"], [4922, 4931, "GENE"], [4953, 4957, "GENE"], [5135, 5144, "GENE"], [5225, 5229, "GENE"], [5301, 5305, "GENE"], [5323, 5330, "DISEASE"], [5684, 5702, "DISEASE"], [6086, 6090, "GENE"], [6557, 6561, "GENE"], [6672, 6676, "GENE"], [6695, 6702, "DISEASE"], [6710, 6714, "GENE"], [6718, 6725, "RELATION"], [6742, 6744, "DISEASE"], [6915, 6922, "DISEASE"], [6963, 6965, "DISEASE"], [7085, 7089, "GENE"], [7358, 7360, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[2171, 2175, 2256, 2274, "increased expression"], [2171, 2175, 2276, 2278, "increased expression"], [3217, 3221, 3397, 3404, "pathological role"]], [[6710, 6714, 6742, 6744, "increased expression"]]], "triplets": [[[2171, 2175, 2256, 2274, [2158, 2177], [2169, 2188]], [2171, 2175, 2276, 2278, [2158, 2177], [2169, 2188]], [3217, 3221, 3397, 3404, 3358, 3393]], [[6710, 6714, 6742, 6744, 6718, 6725]]], "triplets_text": [[["SMOX", "ulcerative colitis", "increase of mRNA levels"], ["SMOX", "UC", "increase of mRNA levels"], ["SMOX", "colitis", "plays a role in the pathophysiology"]], [["SMOX", "UC", "induced"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["test"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nIn this study, we present compelling evidence that polyamines, and more particularly spermidine, can be considered as either beneficial or deleterious in colitis, depending on the etiology.
