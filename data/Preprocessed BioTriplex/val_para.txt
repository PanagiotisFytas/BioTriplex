However, low solubility and poor bioavailability of TanIIA limit its clinical application. Similarly, gene therapy with GPC3-shRNA, a type of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) capable of silencing the glypican-3 (GPC3) expression, is seriously limited due to its susceptibility to nuclease degradation and high off-target effects. In the present study, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-PEG) were used as a drug carrier. By encapsulating TanIIA into MSN-PEG, we synthesized MSN-TanIIA-PEG nanoparticles and observed the involved characteristics. This was followed by exploration of antitumor activity on the HepG2 cell lines  in vitro . Meanwhile, in order to construct GPC3-shRNA plasmids, a shRNA sequence targeting GPC3 was synthesized and cloned into the pSLenti-U6 vector. Accordingly, the performance of MSN-PEG as a gene transfer carrier for GPC3-shRNA gene therapy of HCC  in vitro  was evaluated, including transfection efficiency and DNA binding biological characteristics. The results indicated successful encapsulation of TanIIA in MSN-PEG, which had satisfactory efficacy, favorable dispersity, suitable particle size, and sustained release effect. The  in vitro  anti-HCC effects of nano-TanIIA were greatly improved, which outperformed free-TanIIA in terms of proliferation and invasion inhibition, as well as apoptosis induction of HCC cells. As expected, MSN-PEG possessed excellent gene delivery capacity with good binding, release, and protection from RNase digestion. Using MSN-PEG as a gene carrier, the plasmids were successfully transfected into HepG2 cells, and both the mRNA and protein expressions of GPC3 were significantly downregulated. It was thus concluded that a sustained release TanIIA delivery system for HCC treatment was synthesized and that MSN-PEG could also serve as a gene transfer carrier for gene therapy.

Monodisperse mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were provided by Nanoeast Biotech (Nanjing, China), which are a kind of inorganic nanomaterials with a highly ordered mesoporous structure, good chemical and thermal stability, and a large number of easily modified hydroxyl functional groups on the surface. PEG5k-PEI25k was provided by Tanshui Biotech (Shenzhen, China). The Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647/PI Apoptosis Assay kit was purchased from FcMACS (Nanjing, China). Lipofectamine 2000, Tango Buffer, and DNase-I enzyme were purchased from Solarbio (Beijing, China). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was obtained from Beyotime Biotech (Shanghai, China). Fluorescent Hoechst 33342, crystal violet, and the rest of the reagents were purchased from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).\nThe human HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cell line was obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). HepG2 cells were inoculated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, US) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, US) and supplemented with streptomycin and penicillin (GIBCO, US). The cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2.\n2.2. Preparation of the Nanoparticles\nThe MSN-TanIIA-PEG was prepared according to a film dispersion-ultrasonic method in the published articles [ 9 ,  21 ]. The first step was preparation of TanIIA-loaded MSNs. 5 mg MSN (25 mg/mL) and 500  \u03bc g TanIIA (10 mg/mL) were mixed evenly in ethanol, and then 100  \u03bc L of water was added slowly into the above solution under ultrasonic condition followed by 2-h incubation in a 37\u00b0C shaker. Finally, centrifugation was carried out at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to remove the residual solvent, so as to obtain the required sample (denoted as MSN-TanIIA), which was dried in a 45\u00b0C vacuum for 12 h and then stored at 4\u00b0C.\nThe next step was coating of the prepared MSN-TanIIA with PEI-PEG. In a nutshell, 5 mg MSN-TanIIA (10 mg/mL) was dripped into 20 mg (50 mg/mL) PEI-PEG followed by probe sonication for 20 min. After removing extra PEI-PEG and free-TanIIA in the solution via 10-min centrifugation (10,000 rpm), the remaining was washed three times in 2 mL of saline via 5-min centrifugation (10,000 rpm) to get TanIIA-loaded PEI-PEG-coated MSNs, denoted as MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Meanwhile, MSN-PEG was also prepared by the same method.\nThe entrapped TanIIA in the obtained sample solution was quantified by HPLC. The drug loading capacity (DL, %) and encapsulation efficiency (EE, %) were calculated by the following equations: (1) DL  % = amount of TanIIA encapsulated in NPs  total amount of NPs \u00d7 100 , EE  % = amount of TanIIA loaded in NPs initial TanIIA added \u00d7 100.\n2.3. HPLC Method for Determining TanIIA\n\n           2.3.1. Instruments and Conditions \n           22 ], the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (LC-15C; Shimadzu, Japan) with a WondaSil C18 column (4.6 \u00d7 250 mm, 5  \u03bc m) was used for determination of TanIIA in MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. In addition, the mobile phase of the HPLC system consisted of 70% acetonitrile (A) and 30% ultrapure water (B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, column temperature was kept at 30\u00b0C, and the detection wavelength was 268 nm. Taking the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition) and Liu et al.'s research as reference [ \n        \n\n           2.3.2. Standard Solution and Sample Preparation \n           \u03bc g/mL. Acetonitrile was used to break down the internal structure of the samples, thereby extracting the TanIIA before detecting [ 23 ,  24 ]. TanIIA standard solutions (1 mg/mL) were prepared in acetonitrile and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. Mobile phase was used to dilute standard solutions to the concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100  \n        \n2.4. Characterization of the Nanoparticles\nThe physical and chemical properties of MSN-TanIIA-PEG were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The particle size (nm) and zeta potential (mV) of nanoparticles were evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) at 25\u00b0C using the Zeta Plus Zetasizer (Brookhaven Instruments, USA). All the samples were dispersed in deionized water and sonicated before the analysis. The morphology of the uncoated and coated nanoparticles was observed by a JEM-2100 TEM instrument (JEOL, Japan).\n2.5.  In Vitro  Drug Release\nA dialysis technique was employed for the release profile investigation of TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Initially, 1 mL of the sample solution (1 mg/mL) was added to a dialysis bag (MW:3500), which was soaked in 5 mL of PBS buffer (0.02 M, pH = 7.4, containing 0.2% Tween-80), followed by stirring in a shaking bed at 100 rpm and 37\u00b0C away from light. At the preset points of time, each 1.0 mL of sample was removed from the release medium, and then the system was replenished with an equal volume of PBS. The HPLC was finally employed to examine how much TanIIA was released into the release solution.\n2.6.  In Vitro  Antitumor Activity\nTo investigate the antitumor activity of MSN-TanIIA-PEG,  in vitro  proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were assessed (see Sections  2.6.1 / 2.6.2 / 2.6.3 / 2.6.4 ).\n\n           2.6.1. CCK-8 Assay \n           4  cells were seeded into 96-well plates overnight. Then, the cells were intervened with a series of different concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80  \u03bc g/mL) of free-TanIIA, TanIIA-MSN, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG for 24 h. DMSO was used as a solvent for TanIIA, and thus the HepG2 cells in DMEM containing 0.3% DMSO were used as the untreated control group (0  \u03bc g/mL). Moreover, MSN-PEG was also used as a blank nanoparticle control. Subsequently, 10  \u00b5 L of CCK-8 reagent was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C according to the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, the absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. The cell growth inhibition rate of the HepG2 cells was calculated according to the formula: cell growth inhibition rate (%) = (1 - experimental absorbance value/control absorbance value) \u00d7 100. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) were determined using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (La Jolla, USA). A CCK-8 assay was conducted to determine the cell proliferation inhibitory effect of the three different TanIIA formulations (free-TanIIA, TanIIA-MSN, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG) on HepG2 cells. In brief, the 3 \u00d7 10 \n        \n\n           2.6.2.

Besides, the concentration of MSN-PEG in the MSN-PEG group was 100  \u03bc g/mL. After additional 24-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed with cold PBS. Hoechst 33342 (1  \u03bc g/mL) was added to each well. After being incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, the cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany).

Afterward, the cells were intervened with MSN-PEG (100  \u03bc g/mL), free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG (at an equivalent TanIIA concentration of 10  \u03bc g/mL) for 24 h. Before the intervention, the cells were inoculated at 4 \u00d7 10 \n           \u03bc L) and PI (10  \u03bc L, 20  \u03bc g/mL) at room temperature protected from light for 15 min and a subsequent resuspension in 500  \u03bc L of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 ). The stained cells were detected immediately using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, USA). For apoptosis detection, the cells were collected and PBS-washed followed by staining with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 (5  \n           \u03bc L; 20  \u03bc g/mL PI and 5  \u03bc g/mL RNase A in PBS) in the dark for 30 min at ambient temperature followed by FACSCalibur analysis. For the cell cycle assessment, the cells were harvested, PBS-washed, and fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in cold 70% ethanol. After collecting and washing with PBS, the cells were stained using propidium iodide (PI) solution (100  \n        \n\n           2.6.4. Transwell Assay \n           5  cells) were seeded in a 6-well plate and pretreated with MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Cell invasion ability was measured using the transwell assay. In detail, HepG2 cells (4 \u00d7 10 \n           5  cells (200  \u03bc L) were transferred into the upper transwell chambers (8  \u03bc m; BD Biosciences, USA). The inferior chamber was filled with 500  \u03bc L of 10% FBS-containing DMEM. Following 24-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were subjected to twice PBS washing, 30-min fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, and 20-min staining with crystal violet (0.1%) at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed with water 3 times. After this, a cotton swab was used to remove the nontraveled cells from the upper filter surface in a gentle manner. Finally, the cell pictures were obtained under a microscope and the cell numbers were quantified with ImageJ software. The cell invasion inhibition rate was calculated following this formula: The cell invasion inhibition rate (%) = (cells' count of untreated group - cells' count of the treatment group)/cells' count of untreated group \u00d7 100. Initially, 50 mg/L Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) was coated onto the transwell insert membrane at a 1 : 8 dilution at the apical side. After collection from every group, the cells were resuspended in a serum-free medium, and then 1 \u00d7 10 \n        \n2.7. Construction and Identification of the GPC3-shRNA Plasmid\nThe GPC3-shRNA plasmid was constructed as our previous description [ 25 ]. The plasmid was purchased from Manfute biotech (Nanjing, China). Human GPC3 sequences (GenBank ID: 2719) were selected as the target site for RNAi. For pSLenti-GPC3-shRNA plasmid construction, driven by the U6 promoter, the annealed oligonucleotides (double-stranded) were inserted into pSLenti plasmids by T4 DNA ligation using AegI-EcoRI restriction sites. The primer sequence (designed by Primer3 software) upstream was 5'-CCGGCCGAAGAAGGGAACTAATTCTCAAGAGAAATTAGTTCCCTTCTTCGGTTTTTTG-3', and the downstream was 5'-AATTCAAAAAACCGAAGAAGGGAACTAATTTCTCTTGAGAATTAGTTCCCTTCTTCGG-3'. After shaking the bacterial solution, the positive clones were identified by PCR, the reaction conditions of GPC3-shRNA were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 s, followed by the final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Finally, sequence verification of the resulting pSLenti-U6-GPC3-shRNA plasmids was accomplished via DNA sequencing. Then, the vector NTI software was used to compare and analyze the sequencing results. Meanwhile, to examine the transfection efficiency, GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were constructed as well.\n2.8. DNA Binding, Digestion Protection, and Release Experiments\nFor DNA binding, digestion protection, and release experiments, the methods reported in our previous work were used and the methods description partly reproduced our earlier wording [ 25 ].\n\n           2.8.1. MSN-PEG Binding with GPC3-shRNA Experiment \n           \u03bc L). After 60 min of incubation at room temperature, 5  \u03bc L of each MSN/shRNA complex was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) using 0.5  \u03bc g/mL ethidium bromide (EB), with 40-min running of the gels at 110 V with Tris-acetate (TAE) buffer. Retardation of the motion of shRNA was observed with a UV lamp by using a G:BOX Chemi XX9 imaging system (Syngene, UK). To obtain the proper mass ratio of GPC3-shRNA plasmids to MSN-PEG, the same amount of shRNA was incubated with different concentrations of MSN-PEG solutions. GPC3-shRNA plasmids and MSN-PEG were mixed at the mass ratios of 1 : 0 (naked shRNA), 1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 40, 1 : 60, 1 : 80, and 1 : 100 (final plasmid concentration: 20 ng/ \n        \n\n           2.8.2.

Finally, 5  \u03bc L of each product was electrophoresed. GPC3-shRNA plasmids and MSN-PEG were mixed to form a complex according to a mass ratio of 1 : 20. The complex was then digested with DNase-I enzyme and Tango Buffer at 37\u00b0C for 1, 10, 30, 45, and 60 min. Later, the reaction was terminated by adding EDTA solution (100 mmol/L). This was followed by washing, drying of resultants, and a subsequent dissolution in 200  \n        \n\n           2.8.3.

The complex was made to a 500  \u03bc L volume by mixing with TE solution. For AGE detection, 5  \u03bc L of sample was taken separately at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. GPC3-shRNA plasmids (10  \n        \n2.9. MSN-PEG Transfection Efficiency Detection\nMSN-PEG and GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were individually dispersed in the DMEM culture medium. MSN-PEG and GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were incubated at a mass ratio of 20 : 1 for 30 min to make them mix sufficiently.\nAfter HepG2 cells were cultured overnight, the medium was replaced with the above mixture. The culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEM after 5-h incubation. Additional 24-h incubation sustained before harvesting cells. Meanwhile, Lipofectamine 2000 transfection method, which conducted according to the instruction, served as comparison. The two methods' transfection efficiencies were observed using a fluorescence microscope and analyzed via FACSCalibur.\n2.10. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Analysis\nUsing MSN-PEG as a carrier, the GPC3-shRNA plasmids and negative control were transfected into the HepG2 cells, and 24 h later, cellular mRNA detection of GPC3 was carried out by qRT-PCR. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) was used to extract the cellular total RNA as per the instructions of the manufacturer. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using ReverTra Ace\u2122 qPCR RT Master Mix (TOYOBO Biotech, Japan). The reaction solution was subjected to 15-min incubation at 37\u00b0C and a subsequent 5-min heating to 98\u00b0C as per the instructions of the manufacturer. The final step was qRT-PCR analysis on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher, USA). The comparative Ct (2 -DeltaDeltaCt ) method was used to calculate the relative fold changes of mRNA expression in different groups. The primer sequences are as follows: GPC3 (Beyotime, China): 5'-CCTTTGAAATTGTTCGCCA-3' (forward) and 5'-CCTGGGTTCATTAGCTGGGTA-3' (reverse); GAPDH (Beyotime, China): 5'-CATCTTCTTTTGCGTCGCCA-3' (forward) and 5'-TTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTGACC-3' (reverse).\n2.11. Western Blotting\nTotal proteins from transfected and untransfected HepG2 cells were extracted using RIPA buffer (Vazyme Biotech, China). BCA assay (Beyotime, China) was conducted to quantify the extracted total proteins. For isolation of the protein samples, 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (0.45  \u03bc m) with 300 mA current for 90 min. After transfer, the membranes were blocked in 5% BSA at ambient temperature for 1 h and then incubated overnight using rabbit antibodies against GPC3 (Abcam, USA; diluted 1 : 1000) and a rabbit antibody against GAPDH (Sangon Biotech, China; diluted 1 : 5000) as an internal standard at 4\u00b0C to normalize the protein expressions. On the next day, the membranes were further incubated using goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sangon Biotech, China; diluted 1 : 5000) for 1 h and then subjected to protein visualization using enhanced chemiluminescence (Vazyme Biotech, China). The G:BOX Chemi XX9 imaging system (Syngene, UK) was used for protein visualization.\n2.12. Statistical Analysis\nQuantitative variables were represented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation ( x \u00af  \u00b1  s ).  P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Mobile phase was used to dilute standard solutions to the concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100  \n        \n2.4. Characterization of the Nanoparticles\nThe physical and chemical properties of MSN-TanIIA-PEG were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta potential, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The particle size (nm) and zeta potential (mV) of nanoparticles were evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) at 25\u00b0C using the Zeta Plus Zetasizer (Brookhaven Instruments, USA). All the samples were dispersed in deionized water and sonicated before the analysis. The morphology of the uncoated and coated nanoparticles was observed by a JEM-2100 TEM instrument (JEOL, Japan).\n", "2.5.  In Vitro  Drug Release\nA dialysis technique was employed for the release profile investigation of TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Initially, 1 mL of the sample solution (1 mg/mL) was added to a dialysis bag (MW:3500), which was soaked in 5 mL of PBS buffer (0.02 M, pH = 7.4, containing 0.2% Tween-80), followed by stirring in a shaking bed at 100 rpm and 37\u00b0C away from light. At the preset points of time, each 1.0 mL of sample was removed from the release medium, and then the system was replenished with an equal volume of PBS. The HPLC was finally employed to examine how much TanIIA was released into the release solution.\n", "2.6.  In Vitro  Antitumor Activity\nTo investigate the antitumor activity of MSN-TanIIA-PEG,  in vitro  proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were assessed (see Sections  2.6.1 / 2.6.2 / 2.6.3 / 2.6.4 ).\n", "\n           2.6.1.

DMSO was used as a solvent for TanIIA, and thus the HepG2 cells in DMEM containing 0.3% DMSO were used as the untreated control group (0  \u03bc g/mL). Moreover, MSN-PEG was also used as a blank nanoparticle control. Subsequently, 10  \u00b5 L of CCK-8 reagent was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C according to the manufacturer's protocol. Finally, the absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm. The cell growth inhibition rate of the HepG2 cells was calculated according to the formula: cell growth inhibition rate (%) = (1 - experimental absorbance value/control absorbance value) \u00d7 100. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) were determined using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (La Jolla, USA). A CCK-8 assay was conducted to determine the cell proliferation inhibitory effect of the three different TanIIA formulations (free-TanIIA, TanIIA-MSN, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG) on HepG2 cells.

Besides, the concentration of MSN-PEG in the MSN-PEG group was 100  \u03bc g/mL. After additional 24-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed with cold PBS. Hoechst 33342 (1  \u03bc g/mL) was added to each well. After being incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min, the cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany).

The stained cells were detected immediately using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, USA). For apoptosis detection, the cells were collected and PBS-washed followed by staining with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 (5  \n           \u03bc L; 20  \u03bc g/mL PI and 5  \u03bc g/mL RNase A in PBS) in the dark for 30 min at ambient temperature followed by FACSCalibur analysis. For the cell cycle assessment, the cells were harvested, PBS-washed, and fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in cold 70% ethanol.

Transwell Assay \n           5  cells) were seeded in a 6-well plate and pretreated with MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG. Cell invasion ability was measured using the transwell assay. In detail, HepG2 cells (4 \u00d7 10 \n           5  cells (200  \u03bc L) were transferred into the upper transwell chambers (8  \u03bc m; BD Biosciences, USA). The inferior chamber was filled with 500  \u03bc L of 10% FBS-containing DMEM. Following 24-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were subjected to twice PBS washing, 30-min fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, and 20-min staining with crystal violet (0.1%) at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed with water 3 times. After this, a cotton swab was used to remove the nontraveled cells from the upper filter surface in a gentle manner. Finally, the cell pictures were obtained under a microscope and the cell numbers were quantified with ImageJ software. The cell invasion inhibition rate was calculated following this formula: The cell invasion inhibition rate (%) = (cells' count of untreated group - cells' count of the treatment group)/cells' count of untreated group \u00d7 100. Initially, 50 mg/L Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) was coated onto the transwell insert membrane at a 1 : 8 dilution at the apical side. After collection from every group, the cells were resuspended in a serum-free medium, and then 1 \u00d7 10 \n        \n2.7. Construction and Identification of the GPC3-shRNA Plasmid\nThe GPC3-shRNA plasmid was constructed as our previous description [ 25 ]. The plasmid was purchased from Manfute biotech (Nanjing, China). Human GPC3 sequences (GenBank ID: 2719) were selected as the target site for RNAi. For pSLenti-GPC3-shRNA plasmid construction, driven by the U6 promoter, the annealed oligonucleotides (double-stranded) were inserted into pSLenti plasmids by T4 DNA ligation using AegI-EcoRI restriction sites. The primer sequence (designed by Primer3 software) upstream was 5'-CCGGCCGAAGAAGGGAACTAATTCTCAAGAGAAATTAGTTCCCTTCTTCGGTTTTTTG-3', and the downstream was 5'-AATTCAAAAAACCGAAGAAGGGAACTAATTTCTCTTGAGAATTAGTTCCCTTCTTCGG-3'. After shaking the bacterial solution, the positive clones were identified by PCR, the reaction conditions of GPC3-shRNA were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 s, followed by the final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Finally, sequence verification of the resulting pSLenti-U6-GPC3-shRNA plasmids was accomplished via DNA sequencing. Then, the vector NTI software was used to compare and analyze the sequencing results. Meanwhile, to examine the transfection efficiency, GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were constructed as well.\n", "2.8. DNA Binding, Digestion Protection, and Release Experiments\nFor DNA binding, digestion protection, and release experiments, the methods reported in our previous work were used and the methods description partly reproduced our earlier wording [ 25 ].\n", "\n           2.8.1. MSN-PEG Binding with GPC3-shRNA Experiment \n           \u03bc L). After 60 min of incubation at room temperature, 5  \u03bc L of each MSN/shRNA complex was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) using 0.5  \u03bc g/mL ethidium bromide (EB), with 40-min running of the gels at 110 V with Tris-acetate (TAE) buffer. Retardation of the motion of shRNA was observed with a UV lamp by using a G:BOX Chemi XX9 imaging system (Syngene, UK). To obtain the proper mass ratio of GPC3-shRNA plasmids to MSN-PEG, the same amount of shRNA was incubated with different concentrations of MSN-PEG solutions. GPC3-shRNA plasmids and MSN-PEG were mixed at the mass ratios of 1 : 0 (naked shRNA), 1 : 5, 1 : 10, 1 : 20, 1 : 40, 1 : 60, 1 : 80, and 1 : 100 (final plasmid concentration: 20 ng/ \n        \n\n           2.8.2.

The culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEM after 5-h incubation. Additional 24-h incubation sustained before harvesting cells. Meanwhile, Lipofectamine 2000 transfection method, which conducted according to the instruction, served as comparison. The two methods' transfection efficiencies were observed using a fluorescence microscope and analyzed via FACSCalibur.\n", "2.10. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Analysis\nUsing MSN-PEG as a carrier, the GPC3-shRNA plasmids and negative control were transfected into the HepG2 cells, and 24 h later, cellular mRNA detection of GPC3 was carried out by qRT-PCR. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) was used to extract the cellular total RNA as per the instructions of the manufacturer. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using ReverTra Ace\u2122 qPCR RT Master Mix (TOYOBO Biotech, Japan). The reaction solution was subjected to 15-min incubation at 37\u00b0C and a subsequent 5-min heating to 98\u00b0C as per the instructions of the manufacturer. The final step was qRT-PCR analysis on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher, USA). The comparative Ct (2 -DeltaDeltaCt ) method was used to calculate the relative fold changes of mRNA expression in different groups. The primer sequences are as follows: GPC3 (Beyotime, China): 5'-CCTTTGAAATTGTTCGCCA-3' (forward) and 5'-CCTGGGTTCATTAGCTGGGTA-3' (reverse); GAPDH (Beyotime, China): 5'-CATCTTCTTTTGCGTCGCCA-3' (forward) and 5'-TTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTGACC-3' (reverse).\n", "2.11. Western Blotting\nTotal proteins from transfected and untransfected HepG2 cells were extracted using RIPA buffer (Vazyme Biotech, China). BCA assay (Beyotime, China) was conducted to quantify the extracted total proteins.

After transfer, the membranes were blocked in 5% BSA at ambient temperature for 1 h and then incubated overnight using rabbit antibodies against GPC3 (Abcam, USA; diluted 1 : 1000) and a rabbit antibody against GAPDH (Sangon Biotech, China; diluted 1 : 5000) as an internal standard at 4\u00b0C to normalize the protein expressions.

{"doc_key": "8592735_3. Results and Discussion", "text": ["\n3.1. Characterization of Nanoparticles\n\n           3.1.1. Particle Size, Zeta Potential, and Morphological Features \n           26 ]. In this study, TanIIA-loaded MSN-PEG nanoparticles were prepared, as described previously. The DL and EE of MSN-TanIIA-PEG nanoparticles were 9.32% and 93.13%, respectively. It was reported that nanocarriers have high drug loading capacity, excellent tolerability, high stability, and low drug degradation, which achieve controlled release and sustained delivery of antineoplastics [ \n           2(a) - 2(h)  display the size distribution of the particles, as well as the zeta potential of the MSN, MSN-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA-PEG, and MSN-PEG. As suggested by the results of DLS assessment, MSN has a hydrodynamic size of 78 nm and a zeta potential of -36.0 mV. With the gradual modification of the MSN nanoparticles with TanIIA and PEI-PEG, the MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG exhibited increases in the hydrodynamic size separately to 90 nm and 117 nm. Besides, the surface charges of MSN and MSN-TanIIA were -36 mV and -30 mV, indicating negative charges. Interestingly, both MSN-TanIIA-PEG and MSN-PEG had positive charges with values of 43.2 mV and 47 mV, respectively. This verified the negative-to-positive changes in the surface charges of nanoparticles. The foregoing results imply the successful modification of nanoparticles. Moreover, the positive charges enabled formation of an electrostatic complex by the carrier with shRNA, thereby protecting it from nucleases and facilitating its cellular uptake [ 27 ]. Figures  \n           2(i) - 2(l) , the majority of the nanoparticles, regardless of modified or not, was about 50 nm in particle size, which had a regular spherical shape, uniform particle size, and good monodispersity. The surface-modified particles maintained the basic morphology. Additionally, it was obviously observed that the surface mesoporous pores became blurred, and there was a white halo on the nanoparticle periphery, which corresponded to the surface modification with the polymer layer. It has been reported that nanoparticles with a size of 100-200 nm can be quickly eliminated from the blood by macrophages in the RES after entering the circulation. In contrast, the nanoparticles 50-100 nm in size are capable of entering liver cells and target drugs to the liver [ 2 ]. According to the EPR effect, nanoparticles with particle size less than 100 nm can easily pass through the interstices of the tumor tissue and thus remain in the tumor tissue [ 28 ]. In the present study, the prepared nanoparticle size was about 50 nm, which is in accordance with the preparation requirements of particle size between 50 nm and 100 nm. TEM analysis was performed to elucidate the morphology of the nanoparticles. According to the TEM micrographs in Figures  \n        \n\n           In Vitro  Drug Release 3.1.2.  \n           29 ,  30 ]. For effectiveness validation of the nanoparticles in drug delivery, the  in vitro  release of TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was employed at various time intervals (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h), and the curve of TanIIA release was plotted ( Figure 2(m) ). According to the  in vitro  TanIIA release curve, both MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG showed a typical pattern of two-phase release. The TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was initially released at a rapid rate with 71.89% and 59.7% in the first 6 h, which was denoted as incubation period. From 7 to 24 h, the sustained release phase, the cumulative release of the drug gradually increased. After 12 h, the release gradually decreased, which was followed by the smooth release until 24 h. The sustained release reached 97.27% and 97.95% at 24 h for MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG, respectively. It was obviously seen that the percentage of TanIIA release in MSN-TanIIA was higher than that of MSN-TanIIA-PEG. The high burst release of MSN-TanIIA may prevent drugs from reaching to the target tissues or cells, thus making it less effective. On the contrary, the sustained release of MSN-TanIIA-PEG was more suitable for the drug release properties of nanoparticles [ 31 ]. Some studies have demonstrated that the entrapped drug release from the nanoparticles in a sustained manner extended the plasma biological half-life for the natural compounds [ \n        \n3.2.  In Vitro  Antitumor Activity\n\n           3.2.1. Cell Proliferation Inhibition Assay \n           \u03bc g/mL) using the CCK-8 kit. The results revealed increases in the growth inhibition rates of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC 50  of free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG were 14.842  \u03bc g/mL, 9.298  \u03bc g/mL, and 6.959  \u03bc g/mL, respectively ( Figure 3(a) ), while the blank nanoparticles (MSN-PEG) and DMSO had no significant effects on the cells' growth. Suggestively, the slower and sustained TanIIA release from the MSN-TanIIA-PEG led to reduced effective dose (IC 50 ) and obtained superior therapeutic efficacy  in vitro  to the free-TanIIA for HCC cells. Similar observations have also been reported by Yang et al. [ 12 ] and Sun et al. [ 21 ], where IC 50  of many nanoparticles of natural products was lower than that of the free products. The cell growth inhibition effect was examined under various concentrations of free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG (0-80  \n        \n\n           3.2.2. Cell Apoptosis Assays \n           32 ]. The apoptotic cell nuclei exhibit a high intensity of fluorescence, while weak fluorescence is noted in the nonapoptotic cells [ 33 ]. To evaluate the apoptosis of HepG2 cells induced by MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG, the cellular nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 followed by fluorescence microscope evaluation. Compared with the intact control nuclei, the cells intervened with MSN-PEG showed little difference, while the cells intervened with free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG all exhibited nucleus shrinkage and were stained bright blue or showed debris-like lobulation of nuclei ( Figure 3(b) ). However, within similar sized fields, there were more apoptotic cells in the MSN-TanIIA-PEG group than in the free-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA groups. This observation is consistent with a previous finding that noisome-coated TanIIA could enhance the apoptosis of HepG2 cells [ 2 ]. Hoechst 33342 is typically used for detecting cell apoptosis, and the principle is that it can permeate apoptotic cellular membranes freely, and that apoptotic cells can be identified by the bright blue-stained nuclei that are either condensed or scattered [ \n           Figure 3(c) , the control cells exhibited an exceptionally low apoptosis rate, which was only 8.26 \u00b1 2.83%. In contrast, the cell apoptosis induced by MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG amounted to 12.81 \u00b1 3.40%, 18.92 \u00b1 3.55%, 30.63 \u00b1 4.09%, and 38.68 \u00b1 6.57%, respectively. Obviously, the cell apoptosis induced by MSN-TanIIA-PEG was far stronger than that induced by other methods ( P  < 0.05). The finding was consistent with the result of Hoechst 33342 staining assay. Moreover, the apoptotic results coincided with the cell proliferation inhibition data as well. Subsequently, HepG2 cells intervened with MSN and TanIIA were doubly stained with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 plus PI, and then the cell apoptosis induced by intervention was determined by flow cytometry. As shown in  \n        \n\n           3.2.3. Cell Cycle Assay \n           Figure 3(d) , the MSN-TanIIA-PEG intervention group showed an increased  G 0/ G 1 phase cell population compared with the control group, which was also more significant than the MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA intervention groups. This finding suggested that nano-TanIIA intervention could affect the arrest of cell cycle at  G 0/ G 1, the phases of DNA replication [ 34 ]. In other words, MSN-TanIIA-PEG prevented the duplication of DNA, diminished the S phase cell proportion during DNA synthesis, and inhibited the G2/M phase accumulation of cells. As a result, HepG2 cells' growth and proliferation were effectively suppressed. Following the verification of cell apoptosis effect induced by MSN-TanIIA-PEG, flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the variation trends of HepG2 cell distribution by the MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG over the cell cycle phases. According to  \n           G 0/ G 1 checkpoint in a dose-related manner [ 35 ,  36 ]. It also agreed with the finding of another study demonstrating a differing effect of the drug-entrapped nanoparticles on the distribution of cell cycle from the free-form drug [ 37 ]. However, the effect of TanIIA on the cell cycle distribution remains controversial. Some studies observed that TanIIA could arrest cells at the  S / G 2 phases [ 37 ,  38 ]. After HepG2 cells were intervened with MSN-TanIIA-PEG, the  G 0/ G 1 phase cell distribution increased, while the proportion of S and G2/M phase cells decreased, which remains to be further explored. This finding is consistent with the previous research showing the ability of TanIIA to arrest cells at the  \n        \n\n           3.2.4. Cell Invasion Ability Assay \n           Figure 3(e) ). Compared with the free-TanIIA group, the cell invasion inhibition rate in nano-TanIIA groups (MSN-TanIIA: 59.66 \u00b1 5.09% and MSN-TanIIA-PEG: 71.61 \u00b1 2.58%) was significantly increased. As shown in  Figure 3(e) , HepG2 cells intervened with MSN-TanIIA-PEG exhibited higher cell invasion inhibition rates than other counterparts. These results indicated that MSN-TanIIA-PEG has the strongest cell invasion inhibition effect on HepG2 cells. To explore the role of TanIIA in the HCC development, the transwell experiment was employed to examine how TanIIA affected the HepG2 cell invasiveness. Similar to the above outcomes, TanIIA showed remarkable suppression of cell invasion. The cell invasion inhibition rate of the free-TanIIA group was 35.95 \u00b1 8.98%, which was higher than MSN-PEG group's 20.17 \u00b1 8.54% ( \n           Taken together, our findings suggested that MSN-TanIIA-PEG could suppress HCC cell growth and invasion and promote apoptosis, which may exert a crucial effect on the HCC progression. However, the specific mechanism still needs further verification by molecular biology experiments. \n        \n3.3. Identification of GPC3-shRNA Plasmid\nThe presence of correct clones was identified by sequencing comparison, which implied that the GPC3-shRNA plasmids were constructed successfully ( Figure 4(a) ).\n3.4. Binding, Release, and Digestion of MSN-PEG with GPC3-shRNA Plasmids\nGene therapy targeting GPC3 holds a tremendous potential for HCC treatment, especially the RNAi therapy. The primary difficulty in its clinical application is still the safe and efficient design of delivery carriers. Inspiringly, PEG, a neutral and hydrophilic polymer, has been used widely, which helped lower the cytotoxicity and extend the circulation time. Moreover, there has also been a broad application of positively charged PEI owing to its high DNA condensing and transfection efficiencies [ 20 ,  39 ]. The ability of plasmid binding onto MSN-PEG and the capacities of DNA digestion protection and release were identified by gel retardation assays. As seen from electrophoresis image, when plasmids were added at mass ratios (GPC3-shRNA to MSN-PEG) of 1 : 0, 1 : 5, and 1 : 10, a clear band was observable in the corresponding lane. When the mass ratio was 1 : 20, no band could be observed ( Figure 4(b) ), indicating that GPC3-shRNA plasmids could be completely loaded onto the nanoparticles, so that the optimal binding ratio was 1 : 20.\nElectrophoresis of release assay revealed that no DNA band was observed at 1, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h. Nevertheless, the brightness of the electrophoretic band increased within 48 and 72 h, and there was no significant difference between the 3rd and the 4th day, indicating that MSN-PEG was capable of protecting the pDNA from degradation and reasonably releasing pDNA under appropriate conditions ( Figure 4(c) ).\nIn order to observe the stability of the nanoparticle/pDNA complex, the DNase-I digestion experiment was performed. After the complex of MSN-PEG/GPC3-shRNA was added with DNase-I enzyme, the brightness of the electrophoretic band remained stable in the first 1 h. On the contrary, after digestion with DNase-I enzyme, the naked pDNA was almost completely digested within 1 min, and no bands could be seen on the electrophoresis lane, verifying that nanoparticles could effectively protect the pDNA from nuclease digestion ( Figure 4(d) ).\n3.5. Evaluation of MSN-PEG Gene Transfection Efficiency\nUsing MSN-PEG as a carrier, the GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells for the transfection efficiency observation of GPC3-shRNA plasmids under a fluorescence microscope. As the EGFP expression indicated, no obvious difference was observed in transfection efficiency between MSN-PEG and Lipo2000 in the HepG2 cells ( Figure 5(a) ). Besides, the transfection efficiency of MSN-PEG was 34.37 \u00b1 1.06% as analyzed by flow cytometry, with no significant difference from the liposome group's 31.78 \u00b1 1.30% ( Figure 5(b) ). As suggested by the foregoing findings, MSN-PEG has an encouraging potential as a gene-transferring carrier in gene therapy.\nHepG2 cells were transfected with GPC3-shRNA via MSN-PEG for 24 h, and then GPC3 gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR combined with Western blotting. It was found that GPC3 mRNA expression in the untransfected (control) group differed indistinctly from that in the negative control (NC) group, although they were both higher than that in the GPC3-shRNA plasmid-transfected group ( Figure 5(c) ). Correspondingly, the expression level of GPC3 protein was reduced after GPC3-shRNA plasmid transfection, as shown in  Figure 5(d) . This further confirms the successful establishment of GPC3-shRNA plasmids and the workability of using MSN-PEG to transfer target gene in gene therapy.

Characterization of Nanoparticles\n\n           3.1.1. Particle Size, Zeta Potential, and Morphological Features \n", "           26 ]. In this study, TanIIA-loaded MSN-PEG nanoparticles were prepared, as described previously. The DL and EE of MSN-TanIIA-PEG nanoparticles were 9.32% and 93.13%, respectively. It was reported that nanocarriers have high drug loading capacity, excellent tolerability, high stability, and low drug degradation, which achieve controlled release and sustained delivery of antineoplastics [ \n", "           2(a) - 2(h)  display the size distribution of the particles, as well as the zeta potential of the MSN, MSN-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA-PEG, and MSN-PEG. As suggested by the results of DLS assessment, MSN has a hydrodynamic size of 78 nm and a zeta potential of -36.0 mV. With the gradual modification of the MSN nanoparticles with TanIIA and PEI-PEG, the MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG exhibited increases in the hydrodynamic size separately to 90 nm and 117 nm. Besides, the surface charges of MSN and MSN-TanIIA were -36 mV and -30 mV, indicating negative charges. Interestingly, both MSN-TanIIA-PEG and MSN-PEG had positive charges with values of 43.2 mV and 47 mV, respectively. This verified the negative-to-positive changes in the surface charges of nanoparticles. The foregoing results imply the successful modification of nanoparticles. Moreover, the positive charges enabled formation of an electrostatic complex by the carrier with shRNA, thereby protecting it from nucleases and facilitating its cellular uptake [ 27 ]. Figures  \n", "           2(i) - 2(l) , the majority of the nanoparticles, regardless of modified or not, was about 50 nm in particle size, which had a regular spherical shape, uniform particle size, and good monodispersity. The surface-modified particles maintained the basic morphology. Additionally, it was obviously observed that the surface mesoporous pores became blurred, and there was a white halo on the nanoparticle periphery, which corresponded to the surface modification with the polymer layer. It has been reported that nanoparticles with a size of 100-200 nm can be quickly eliminated from the blood by macrophages in the RES after entering the circulation. In contrast, the nanoparticles 50-100 nm in size are capable of entering liver cells and target drugs to the liver [ 2 ]. According to the EPR effect, nanoparticles with particle size less than 100 nm can easily pass through the interstices of the tumor tissue and thus remain in the tumor tissue [ 28 ]. In the present study, the prepared nanoparticle size was about 50 nm, which is in accordance with the preparation requirements of particle size between 50 nm and 100 nm. TEM analysis was performed to elucidate the morphology of the nanoparticles. According to the TEM micrographs in Figures  \n", "        \n\n           In Vitro  Drug Release 3.1.2.  \n           29 ,  30 ]. For effectiveness validation of the nanoparticles in drug delivery, the  in vitro  release of TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was employed at various time intervals (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h), and the curve of TanIIA release was plotted ( Figure 2(m) ). According to the  in vitro  TanIIA release curve, both MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG showed a typical pattern of two-phase release. The TanIIA from MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG was initially released at a rapid rate with 71.89% and 59.7% in the first 6 h, which was denoted as incubation period. From 7 to 24 h, the sustained release phase, the cumulative release of the drug gradually increased. After 12 h, the release gradually decreased, which was followed by the smooth release until 24 h. The sustained release reached 97.27% and 97.95% at 24 h for MSN-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA-PEG, respectively. It was obviously seen that the percentage of TanIIA release in MSN-TanIIA was higher than that of MSN-TanIIA-PEG. The high burst release of MSN-TanIIA may prevent drugs from reaching to the target tissues or cells, thus making it less effective. On the contrary, the sustained release of MSN-TanIIA-PEG was more suitable for the drug release properties of nanoparticles [ 31 ]. Some studies have demonstrated that the entrapped drug release from the nanoparticles in a sustained manner extended the plasma biological half-life for the natural compounds [ \n", "        \n3.2.  In Vitro  Antitumor Activity\n\n           3.2.1. Cell Proliferation Inhibition Assay \n", "           \u03bc g/mL) using the CCK-8 kit. The results revealed increases in the growth inhibition rates of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC 50  of free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG were 14.842  \u03bc g/mL, 9.298  \u03bc g/mL, and 6.959  \u03bc g/mL, respectively ( Figure 3(a) ), while the blank nanoparticles (MSN-PEG) and DMSO had no significant effects on the cells' growth. Suggestively, the slower and sustained TanIIA release from the MSN-TanIIA-PEG led to reduced effective dose (IC 50 ) and obtained superior therapeutic efficacy  in vitro  to the free-TanIIA for HCC cells. Similar observations have also been reported by Yang et al. [ 12 ] and Sun et al. [ 21 ], where IC 50  of many nanoparticles of natural products was lower than that of the free products. The cell growth inhibition effect was examined under various concentrations of free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG (0-80  \n", "        \n\n           3.2.2. Cell Apoptosis Assays \n           32 ]. The apoptotic cell nuclei exhibit a high intensity of fluorescence, while weak fluorescence is noted in the nonapoptotic cells [ 33 ]. To evaluate the apoptosis of HepG2 cells induced by MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG, the cellular nuclei were stained using Hoechst 33342 followed by fluorescence microscope evaluation. Compared with the intact control nuclei, the cells intervened with MSN-PEG showed little difference, while the cells intervened with free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG all exhibited nucleus shrinkage and were stained bright blue or showed debris-like lobulation of nuclei ( Figure 3(b) ). However, within similar sized fields, there were more apoptotic cells in the MSN-TanIIA-PEG group than in the free-TanIIA and MSN-TanIIA groups. This observation is consistent with a previous finding that noisome-coated TanIIA could enhance the apoptosis of HepG2 cells [ 2 ]. Hoechst 33342 is typically used for detecting cell apoptosis, and the principle is that it can permeate apoptotic cellular membranes freely, and that apoptotic cells can be identified by the bright blue-stained nuclei that are either condensed or scattered [ \n", "           Figure 3(c) , the control cells exhibited an exceptionally low apoptosis rate, which was only 8.26 \u00b1 2.83%. In contrast, the cell apoptosis induced by MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG amounted to 12.81 \u00b1 3.40%, 18.92 \u00b1 3.55%, 30.63 \u00b1 4.09%, and 38.68 \u00b1 6.57%, respectively. Obviously, the cell apoptosis induced by MSN-TanIIA-PEG was far stronger than that induced by other methods ( P  < 0.05). The finding was consistent with the result of Hoechst 33342 staining assay. Moreover, the apoptotic results coincided with the cell proliferation inhibition data as well. Subsequently, HepG2 cells intervened with MSN and TanIIA were doubly stained with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 647 plus PI, and then the cell apoptosis induced by intervention was determined by flow cytometry. As shown in  \n        \n\n           3.2.3. Cell Cycle Assay \n           Figure 3(d) , the MSN-TanIIA-PEG intervention group showed an increased  G 0/ G 1 phase cell population compared with the control group, which was also more significant than the MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA intervention groups. This finding suggested that nano-TanIIA intervention could affect the arrest of cell cycle at  G 0/ G 1, the phases of DNA replication [ 34 ]. In other words, MSN-TanIIA-PEG prevented the duplication of DNA, diminished the S phase cell proportion during DNA synthesis, and inhibited the G2/M phase accumulation of cells. As a result, HepG2 cells' growth and proliferation were effectively suppressed. Following the verification of cell apoptosis effect induced by MSN-TanIIA-PEG, flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the variation trends of HepG2 cell distribution by the MSN-PEG, free-TanIIA, MSN-TanIIA, and MSN-TanIIA-PEG over the cell cycle phases. According to  \n           G 0/ G 1 checkpoint in a dose-related manner [ 35 ,  36 ]. It also agreed with the finding of another study demonstrating a differing effect of the drug-entrapped nanoparticles on the distribution of cell cycle from the free-form drug [ 37 ]. However, the effect of TanIIA on the cell cycle distribution remains controversial. Some studies observed that TanIIA could arrest cells at the  S / G 2 phases [ 37 ,  38 ]. After HepG2 cells were intervened with MSN-TanIIA-PEG, the  G 0/ G 1 phase cell distribution increased, while the proportion of S and G2/M phase cells decreased, which remains to be further explored. This finding is consistent with the previous research showing the ability of TanIIA to arrest cells at the  \n        \n\n           3.2.4. Cell Invasion Ability Assay \n           Figure 3(e) ). Compared with the free-TanIIA group, the cell invasion inhibition rate in nano-TanIIA groups (MSN-TanIIA: 59.66 \u00b1 5.09% and MSN-TanIIA-PEG: 71.61 \u00b1 2.58%) was significantly increased. As shown in  Figure 3(e) , HepG2 cells intervened with MSN-TanIIA-PEG exhibited higher cell invasion inhibition rates than other counterparts. These results indicated that MSN-TanIIA-PEG has the strongest cell invasion inhibition effect on HepG2 cells. To explore the role of TanIIA in the HCC development, the transwell experiment was employed to examine how TanIIA affected the HepG2 cell invasiveness. Similar to the above outcomes, TanIIA showed remarkable suppression of cell invasion. The cell invasion inhibition rate of the free-TanIIA group was 35.95 \u00b1 8.98%, which was higher than MSN-PEG group's 20.17 \u00b1 8.54% ( \n           Taken together, our findings suggested that MSN-TanIIA-PEG could suppress HCC cell growth and invasion and promote apoptosis, which may exert a crucial effect on the HCC progression. However, the specific mechanism still needs further verification by molecular biology experiments. \n", "        \n3.3. Identification of GPC3-shRNA Plasmid\nThe presence of correct clones was identified by sequencing comparison, which implied that the GPC3-shRNA plasmids were constructed successfully ( Figure 4(a) ).\n", "3.4. Binding, Release, and Digestion of MSN-PEG with GPC3-shRNA Plasmids\nGene therapy targeting GPC3 holds a tremendous potential for HCC treatment, especially the RNAi therapy. The primary difficulty in its clinical application is still the safe and efficient design of delivery carriers. Inspiringly, PEG, a neutral and hydrophilic polymer, has been used widely, which helped lower the cytotoxicity and extend the circulation time. Moreover, there has also been a broad application of positively charged PEI owing to its high DNA condensing and transfection efficiencies [ 20 ,  39 ]. The ability of plasmid binding onto MSN-PEG and the capacities of DNA digestion protection and release were identified by gel retardation assays. As seen from electrophoresis image, when plasmids were added at mass ratios (GPC3-shRNA to MSN-PEG) of 1 : 0, 1 : 5, and 1 : 10, a clear band was observable in the corresponding lane. When the mass ratio was 1 : 20, no band could be observed ( Figure 4(b) ), indicating that GPC3-shRNA plasmids could be completely loaded onto the nanoparticles, so that the optimal binding ratio was 1 : 20.\n", "Electrophoresis of release assay revealed that no DNA band was observed at 1, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h. Nevertheless, the brightness of the electrophoretic band increased within 48 and 72 h, and there was no significant difference between the 3rd and the 4th day, indicating that MSN-PEG was capable of protecting the pDNA from degradation and reasonably releasing pDNA under appropriate conditions ( Figure 4(c) ).\n", "In order to observe the stability of the nanoparticle/pDNA complex, the DNase-I digestion experiment was performed. After the complex of MSN-PEG/GPC3-shRNA was added with DNase-I enzyme, the brightness of the electrophoretic band remained stable in the first 1 h. On the contrary, after digestion with DNase-I enzyme, the naked pDNA was almost completely digested within 1 min, and no bands could be seen on the electrophoresis lane, verifying that nanoparticles could effectively protect the pDNA from nuclease digestion ( Figure 4(d) ).\n", "3.5. Evaluation of MSN-PEG Gene Transfection Efficiency\nUsing MSN-PEG as a carrier, the GPC3-shRNA-EGFP plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells for the transfection efficiency observation of GPC3-shRNA plasmids under a fluorescence microscope. As the EGFP expression indicated, no obvious difference was observed in transfection efficiency between MSN-PEG and Lipo2000 in the HepG2 cells ( Figure 5(a) ). Besides, the transfection efficiency of MSN-PEG was 34.37 \u00b1 1.06% as analyzed by flow cytometry, with no significant difference from the liposome group's 31.78 \u00b1 1.30% ( Figure 5(b) ). As suggested by the foregoing findings, MSN-PEG has an encouraging potential as a gene-transferring carrier in gene therapy.\n", "HepG2 cells were transfected with GPC3-shRNA via MSN-PEG for 24 h, and then GPC3 gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR combined with Western blotting. It was found that GPC3 mRNA expression in the untransfected (control) group differed indistinctly from that in the negative control (NC) group, although they were both higher than that in the GPC3-shRNA plasmid-transfected group ( Figure 5(c) ). Correspondingly, the expression level of GPC3 protein was reduced after GPC3-shRNA plasmid transfection, as shown in  Figure 5(d) . This further confirms the successful establishment of GPC3-shRNA plasmids and the workability of using MSN-PEG to transfer target gene in gene therapy. In a word, it offered a new idea of using MSN-PEG as a vector to carry TanIIA and GPC3-shRNA for comprehensive treatment of HCC in clinics.\n"]}

Introduction", "text": ["\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as a malignancy characterized by high incidence and mortality, harms people's life and health in a tremendous manner. Seriously, its mortality and morbidity have been steadily increasing over the last few decades [ 1 ]. To date, chemotherapy remains the most common treatment for all stages of carcinoma patients. However, several potential chemotherapeutics that can treat HCC still show limitations such as severe adverse reactions and drug resistance [ 2 ]. Moreover, the intricacy of the molecular pathogenesis poses great difficulties on seeking cure. Enormous endeavors have thus been made to develop high-efficacy multitarget antineoplastics with less adverse effects.\nSeveral effective plant constituents, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine with insignificant adverse actions, have aroused a wide range of interest as an adjuvant therapy [ 3 ]. Among them, TanIIA, an effective component extracted from the  Salvia miltiorrhiza  roots, features high efficacy, natural source, and low toxicity [ 4 ]. Based on the existing studies on TanIIA, it exerts a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in a variety of human carcinoma cells by suppressing proliferation and migration, triggering autophagy and apoptosis, and reversing the multidrug resistance [ 5 ]. Additionally, TanIIA has a synergistic effect in combination with other chemotherapeutics commonly used in clinics, which makes its application in the cancer and adjuvant therapies promising and offers a new insight into diverse cancer treatments as well [ 6 ].\nUnsatisfactorily, being a lipophilic constituent, TanIIA is poorly bioavailable, which limits its further application [ 7 ]. Due to poor water solubility, it exhibits robust hepatic elimination after oral medication and can be easily eliminated from the circulatory system after intravenous medication [ 8 ,  9 ]. Hence, diverse delivery systems (nanoscale) have been proposed for controlled release of TanIIA, in order to overcome its disadvantages and to elevate its bioavailability [ 2 ,  9 ].\nAmongst various nano-based drug delivery platforms developed, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have attracted a considerable attention owing to their good biocompatibility, monodispersity, feeble toxicity, tunable pore size, and large pore volumes, among other characteristics [ 10 ]. Despite being in part a potential solution to the foregoing problems with TanIIA, it still cannot escape the influence of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Rapid elimination by the RES will inevitably hamper the nanosized drugs' absorption efficiency in tumor regions, leading to reduced bioavailability [ 11 ]. Being highly hydrophilic and positively charged, PEG is commonly used to decorate nanoparticles [ 12 ], which has been proven as one of the most effective methods to improve nanoparticle biodistribution and reduce opsonization by the RES [ 11 ].\nStudies over the last decades have demonstrated that GPC3 is highly and specifically expressed in HCC, revealing its potential from an encouraging biomarker for the early HCC detection to an effective epitope for targeted HCC treatment. Past several years have witnessed the exploration of the GPC3-targeting gene therapies [ 13 ,  14 ]. As promising as it looks, their applications are severely limited because of the physicochemical traits of nucleotide drugs, including high molecular weight, susceptibility to nuclease degradation, easy missing of target, and anionic charge [ 15 ]. This has necessitated carrier design as the gene therapy advances in order to achieve highly efficient drug delivery to the target cells. ShRNAs, the small molecules of RNA, have specific function of gene silencing, which can be delivered to the targets via the support of nanoparticles [ 16 ]. Recently, nanostructured carriers such as PEG and PEI or inorganic nanoparticles have shown multiple advantages concerning RNA interference (RNAi) delivery [ 17 ]. PEI, as one of the most classic nonviral vectors, is the most broadly applied polycation transfection reagent owing to its high stability and transfection performance, while PEI-25k has been considered the gold standard for nonviral vectors [ 18 ,  19 ]. Moreover, PEI combined with PEG could improve the systemic circulation and prolong the treatment time [ 19 ,  20 ].\nBased on the aforementioned theory, this study aims to construct an intelligent nanoplatform to improve the water solubility and bioavailability of TanIIA, which also serves as a vehicle of GPC3-shRNA. Herein, we propose a facile method, where TanIIA was physically adsorbed by mesoporous silica and then surface-modified with PEI-PEG to make it positively charged. In this way, the stability of the complex can be improved, which is conducive to loading GPC3-shRNA plasmids. The physicochemical property elucidation of the complex was accomplished,  in vitro  antitumor activities were investigated, and the feasibility of MSN-PEG as a GPC3-shRNA carrier was explored.

The final training set data are presented in  Table S3 , clinical follow-up information is shown in  Table S4 , testing set data are displayed in  Table S5 , and clinical follow-up information is illustrated in  Table S6 .\nUnivariate and Multifactor Survival Analysis of the Training Set Immune-Related Genes\nAll immune-related genes, as well as the survival data, were analyzed by the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model using the survival coxph function of the R package, and  p  < 0.05 was used as the significance level. The immune-related genes from the training set samples that were significant based on both univariate and multivariate analyses were selected as characteristic biomarkers for further analysis.\nMolecular Subtyping of Lung Adenocarcinoma, Screening of Prognosis-Specific Immune-Related Genes, and Construction of the Prognostic Prediction Model\nFirst, the pheatmap from R software package ( 15 ) was used for the hierarchical clustering analysis of immune-related genes that were significant based on both univariate and multivariate analyses, and the similarity distances between the samples were calculated based on the Euclidean distance.\nMoreover, glmnet from the R software package ( 16 ) was used for the LASSO Cox regression analysis, and the prognostic prediction model was constructed, which included 14 immune-related genes.

Based on this, survivalROC from the R software package ( 17 ) was further utilized for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the high- and low-risk prognostic classifications of the RiskScore. For this, the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-years prognostic prediction efficacies were analyzed.\nFunctional Annotations and Signaling Pathway Enrichment Analysis of the Prognosis-Specific Immune-Related Genes\nclusterProfiler from the R software package ( 18 ) was selected for functional gene annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis based on the aforementioned 14 prognosis-specific immune-related genes.\nCorrelations Between the RiskScore and Clinical Features of Training Set Samples and Signaling Pathways\nFirst, the distributions of the RiskScore among different clinical stages, invasion degrees, and lymph node metastasis degrees were analyzed. Next, stage classification was incorporated into the model to construct a multivariate regression model; 5-year survival predicted by the ROC curves for three models, namely, stage, RiskScore, and stage+RiskScore, were then compared. The median risk score of each model was used as the threshold to divide the samples into high- and low-risk groups to draw the Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve to evaluate differences in prognostic classifications among the three models. Then, the ssGSEA function of the R software package GSVA ( 19 ) was utilized to analyze the KEGG functional enrichment score of each sample in the training set. The correlation with the RiskScore was calculated based on the enrichment score of each sample for each pathway, and the top 20 most related KEGG pathways were selected for clustering analysis based on their enrichment scores.\nTest Set Sample Verification\nThe expression profile data of prognosis-specific immune-related genes were extracted from the test set and substituted into the model for calculation. The predicted results were calculated, and the prediction accuracy of this prognosis classification model, as well as the stability of immune feature recognition, was verified and analyzed.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe TCGA dataset was randomly divided in half into a training and testing set, where the training set was analyzed to identify potential prognostic genes and the testing set and entire set were used for validation.\nFirst, Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the expression of immune-associated genes and patient overall survival (OS). Genes with a  p -value of < 0.05 based on the log-rank test were selected as candidate variables. Second, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox method was applied to reduce the number of candidate genes and to select the most significant immune-associated genes to build a prognostic risk score model. The formula of the risk score model is described as follows:\n\n           Riskscore \n                   = \n                   \u2211 \n                       \n                         \n                       i \n                         = \n                         0 \n                       \n                         \n                       n \n                       \n                         \n                     \n                       \n                   \n                     \n                   beta \n                   i \n                     \n                       \n                     * \n                     \n                       \n                   \n                     \n                   \u03c7 \n                   i \n                 \n                   \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n        \nwhere betai refers to the coefficients of each gene and \u03c7i represents the expression value of the gene (FPKM). The risk score model was calculated for each patient and used to classify each patient into a low- or high-risk group based on the median risk score of the training dataset as the cutoff. Patients in the low-risk group had a higher OS, and those included in the high-risk group had a lower OS. KM survival curves and log-rank tests were used to assess differences in OS between the predicted high- and low-risk groups. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic and prognostic prediction models were analyzed by the ROC curve and quantified based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC). All statistical tests were two-sided and  p -values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.0) and Bio-conductor.\n"], "ner": [[[68, 87, "DISEASE"]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], "sentences": ["\nPre-processing of Preliminary Sample Data and Primary Screening of Lung Adenocarcinoma Immune-Related Genes\nThe latest clinical follow-up information was downloaded using TCGA GDC API, as shown in  Table S1 .

Patients in the low-risk group had a higher OS, and those included in the high-risk group had a lower OS. KM survival curves and log-rank tests were used to assess differences in OS between the predicted high- and low-risk groups. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic and prognostic prediction models were analyzed by the ROC curve and quantified based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC). All statistical tests were two-sided and  p -values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.0) and Bio-conductor.\n"]}

Survival data for each immune-related gene were subjected to univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis using the survival coxph function of the R package, with the significance threshold set as  p  < 0.05, as shown in  Table S7 . Eventually, 134 immune-related genes that were significantly differentially expressed with respect to prognosis were discovered, and the top 20 are shown in  Table 1 . Similarly, our results indicated that, T, N, and stage were also significantly correlated with prognosis, with log-rank  p -values of 0.0002, 9.371E-06, and 2.15E-08, respectively ( Table 2 ). Moreover, the univariate Cox model was used to select significant immune-related genes for multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis, with T, N, and stage used as the co-variants for this model. Finally, 64 significant immune-related genes were obtained (see  Table S8 ), and immune-related genes ( n  = 64) from the training set samples that were significant based on both univariate and

Adenocarcinoma Subtypes and Clinical Feature Analysis\nPheatmap from the R software package was used for hierarchical cluster analysis of the immune-related genes that were significant based on both single-factor and multi-factor analyses, and similarity distances between samples were calculated according to the Euclidean distance, as shown in  Figure 1A . These samples could be mainly clustered into two clusters, namely, Cluster1 and Cluster2. Among them, the proportion of samples associated with lymph node metastasis from Cluster1 was 47%, whereas that in Cluster2 was 26%; the difference between these two clusters was significant (chi-square test,  p  < 0.001). The proportion of samples exhibiting T1 invasion in Cluster1 was 22.6%, whereas that in Cluster2 was 39.8%, and this difference was also statistically significant (chi-square test,  p  < 0.001). The proportion of early-stage samples (Stage I and Stage II) in Cluster1 was 72.3%, whereas that in Cluster2 was 84.8%, and this difference was statistically significant (chi-square test,  p  < 0.001). Furthermore, the difference in prognosis between Cluster1 and Cluster2 was also analyzed, as presented in  Figure 1B . There was also a significant difference in their prognoses ( p  < 0.001). These results suggested that immune-related genes could be used to predict prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients.\nScreening of Prognosis-Specific Immune-Related Genes and Construction of the Prognosis Prediction Model\nAt present, 64 immune-related genes have been recognized, which can be used to predict and distinguish prognostic differences between Cluster1 and Cluster2; however, this large number represents a disadvantage for clinical detection. Therefore, the number of immune-related genes was further narrowed such that high accuracy was maintained. The LASSO algorithm is a shrinkage estimate that can be used to construct a penalty function and obtain a relatively refined model; here, some coefficients can be shrunk and some are set to zero. Consequently, it preserves the advantages of subset shrinkage and is a biased estimate that can be utilized to process the multi-collinear data, which can estimate parameters while realizing variable selection, thus solving the multi-collinearity issue in regression analysis. In this study, glmnet from the R software package was used for LASSO Cox regression analysis. First, the change in trajectory of each independent variable was analyzed, as presented in  Figure 2A , and this suggested that more independent variables had coefficients approaching zero with a gradual increase in lambda. Moreover, 3-fold cross-validation was also employed for model construction, and the confidence interval under each lambda is presented in  Figure 2B . This revealed that the optimal model could be attained at lambda = 0.0711. As a result, this value was selected as the final model, which included 14 genes, and the model formula is shown in section Materials and Methods.\nBased on this, samples in each training set were substituted into the formula to calculate the sample RiskScore. The RiskScore distribution of Cluster1 and Cluster2 was then plotted, as shown in  Figure 3A . It can be observed that the RiskScore in Cluster1 samples was generally greater than that in Cluster2 samples, whereas the OS in Cluster1 samples was remarkably lower than that in Cluster2, suggesting that samples with a high RiskScore had a poorer prognosis. Further, survivalROC of the R software package was adopted to perform ROC analysis of the prognostic classification of RiskScore. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-years prognosis prediction classification efficiencies were analyzed, as shown in  Figure 3B . It could be seen that the model demonstrated a high area under the curve (AUC), with an average value > 0.8.\nFunctional Annotations of Prognosis-Specific Immune-Related Genes and Signaling Pathway Enrichment 1\nThe immune relationships among these 14 genes were then analyzed, as shown in  Table 3 . It could be observed that 8 (57%) were related to Cytokine_Receptors. Subsequently, clusterProfiler of the R software package was used to perform KEGG enrichment analysis of these 14 genes with a threshold of  p  < 0.05. Finally, 10 significantly enriched pathways were obtained, as presented in  Figure 4 .

The RiskScores among different stages were statistically significant, and a higher stage was associated with a higher RiskScore. Similar phenomena could also be observed for invasion degree and lymph node metastasis degree, which revealed that the RiskScore was potentially associated with the clinical stage.\nFurthermore, the stage was incorporated into the model to construct the multivariate regression model. The 5-year survival predicted ROC curves of the three single models, namely, stage, RiskScore, and stage+RiskScore, were compared as presented in  Figure 6A . Clearly, the AUC values followed the order stage+RiskScore > RiskScore > stage, and the stage+RiskScore value was significantly higher than those in the other two models. The respective median RiskScores of the three models were then used as thresholds to divide the samples into high- and low-risk groups, and a K-M curve was plotted, as shown in  Figures 6B-D . Obviously, the stage+RiskScore model was associated with the most significant difference in prognosis. Based on this, the clinical features including age, sex, T, N, and stage were combined with the RiskScore to construct the nomogram model and to plot the 1-, 3-, and 5-years survival predicted by the ROC curves ( Figures 7A-C ).\nFinally, the ssGSEA function of GSVA in the R software package was used to analyze the KEGG functional enrichment score of each sample in the training set. The respective correlations with RiskScores were also calculated based on the enrichment score of each pathway in each sample, and the top 20 most related KEGG pathways were selected. Clustering analysis was performed according to enrichment scores, as presented in  Figure 8A . Clearly, most samples were enriched in pathways closely correlated with tumorigenesis, such as P53, cell cycle, and DNA repair. These pathways could group the samples into two clusters, namely, Cluster1 and Cluster2. The RiskScore of Cluster2 was higher than that of Cluster1 and the RiskScore distribution of the two clusters was analyzed, as displayed in  Figure 8C . The RiskScore of Cluster2 samples was remarkably higher than that of Cluster1. Meanwhile, the correlations between these 20 pathways and RiskScore are presented in  Figure 8B . Based on this, seven pathways had a negative correlation, whereas 13 had a positive correlation, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.388.\nTest Set Sample Verification\nSubsequently, to further verify the stability and reliability of the prognostic prediction model, expression profile data of these 14 genes were extracted from the test set and substituted into the model for verification. The RiskScore of each sample was calculated, and the ROC curves were plotted based on these values; as presented in  Figure 9A , the AUC was > 0.7. Furthermore, the median was used to divide the samples into high- and low-risk groups and to analyze the difference in prognosis between the two groups, as presented in  Figure 9B . Clearly, there was a significant difference in prognosis between these two clusters with a  p -value of 0.00563. Moreover, the prognosis for low-risk samples was remarkably superior to that for the other samples, which was consistent with the training set data. In summary, the prognosis model constructed based on the expression profiles of these 14 prognosis-specific immune-related genes had high predictive accuracy and stability to identify immune features.\n"], "ner": [[[94, 113, "DISEASE"]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [[2143, 2151, "GENE"], [2341, 2345, "GENE"], [2534, 2541, "GENE"], [2730, 2734, "GENE"], [2923, 2930, "GENE"], [3120, 3125, "GENE"], [3315, 3321, "GENE"], [3510, 3516, "GENE"], [3705, 3712, "GENE"], [3901, 3908, "GENE"], [4098, 4104, "GENE"], [4293, 4298, "GENE"], [4488, 4493, "GENE"], [4682, 4687, "GENE"], [4877, 4881, "GENE"], [5070, 5075, "GENE"], [5263, 5267, "GENE"], [5457, 5464, "GENE"], [5654, 5660, "GENE"]], [], [], [], [], [[11920, 11926, "GENE"], [11945, 12004, "GENE"], [12143, 12147, "GENE"], [12166, 12192, "GENE"], [12194, 12207, "GENE"], [12326, 12329, "GENE"], [12348, 12386, "GENE"], [12538, 12542, "GENE"], [12561, 12589, "GENE"], [12702, 12706, "GENE"], [12873, 12878, "GENE"], [12897, 12992, "GENE"], [13105, 13112, "GENE"], [13131, 13150, "GENE"], [13272, 13277, "GENE"], [13296, 13327, "GENE"], [13449, 13455, "GENE"], [13474, 13502, "GENE"], [13624, 13628, "GENE"], [13647, 13701, "GENE"], [13823, 13827, "GENE"], [13846, 13917, "GENE"], [14039, 14043, "GENE"], [14062, 14160, "GENE"], [14282, 14290, "GENE"], [14309, 14362, "GENE"], [14484, 14492, "GENE"], [14511, 14564, "GENE"]], [], [], [], []], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], "sentences": ["\nMining of Characteristic Immune-Related Genes Based on the Survival and Prognosis Results of Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients\nFirst, a series of data downloaded from TCGA and ImmPort databases were pre-processed (see Materials and Methods). Survival data for each immune-related gene were subjected to univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis using the survival coxph function of the R package, with the significance threshold set as  p  < 0.05, as shown in  Table S7 . Eventually, 134 immune-related genes that were significantly differentially expressed with respect to prognosis were discovered, and the top 20 are shown in  Table 1 . Similarly, our results indicated that, T, N, and stage were also significantly correlated with prognosis, with log-rank  p -values of 0.0002, 9.371E-06, and 2.15E-08, respectively ( Table 2 ). Moreover, the univariate Cox model was used to select significant immune-related genes for multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis, with T, N, and stage used as the co-variants for this model. Finally, 64 significant immune-related genes were obtained (see  Table S8 ), and immune-related genes ( n  = 64) from the training set samples that were significant based on both univariate and multivariate analyses were selected as characteristic biomarkers for further analysis.\n", "\n           Table 1 \n           Top 20 immune-related genes regarding prognosis. \n           \n

of Lung Adenocarcinoma Subtypes and Clinical Feature Analysis\nPheatmap from the R software package was used for hierarchical cluster analysis of the immune-related genes that were significant based on both single-factor and multi-factor analyses, and similarity distances between samples were calculated according to the Euclidean distance, as shown in  Figure 1A . These samples could be mainly clustered into two clusters, namely, Cluster1 and Cluster2. Among them, the proportion of samples associated with lymph node metastasis from Cluster1 was 47%, whereas that in Cluster2 was 26%; the difference between these two clusters was significant (chi-square test,  p  < 0.001). The proportion of samples exhibiting T1 invasion in Cluster1 was 22.6%, whereas that in Cluster2 was 39.8%, and this difference was also statistically significant (chi-square test,  p  < 0.001). The proportion of early-stage samples (Stage I and Stage II) in Cluster1 was 72.3%, whereas that in Cluster2 was 84.8%, and this difference was statistically significant (chi-square test,  p  < 0.001). Furthermore, the difference in prognosis between Cluster1 and Cluster2 was also analyzed, as presented in  Figure 1B . There was also a significant difference in their prognoses ( p  < 0.001). These results suggested that immune-related genes could be used to predict prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients.\n", "Screening of Prognosis-Specific Immune-Related Genes and Construction of the Prognosis Prediction Model\nAt present, 64 immune-related genes have been recognized, which can be used to predict and distinguish prognostic differences between Cluster1 and Cluster2; however, this large number represents a disadvantage for clinical detection. Therefore, the number of immune-related genes was further narrowed such that high accuracy was maintained. The LASSO algorithm is a shrinkage estimate that can be used to construct a penalty function and obtain a relatively refined model; here, some coefficients can be shrunk and some are set to zero. Consequently, it preserves the advantages of subset shrinkage and is a biased estimate that can be utilized to process the multi-collinear data, which can estimate parameters while realizing variable selection, thus solving the multi-collinearity issue in regression analysis. In this study, glmnet from the R software package was used for LASSO Cox regression analysis. First, the change in trajectory of each independent variable was analyzed, as presented in  Figure 2A , and this suggested that more independent variables had coefficients approaching zero with a gradual increase in lambda. Moreover, 3-fold cross-validation was also employed for model construction, and the confidence interval under each lambda is presented in  Figure 2B . This revealed that the optimal model could be attained at lambda = 0.0711. As a result, this value was selected as the final model, which included 14 genes, and the model formula is shown in section Materials and Methods.\n", "Based on this, samples in each training set were substituted into the formula to calculate the sample RiskScore. The RiskScore distribution of Cluster1 and Cluster2 was then plotted, as shown in  Figure 3A . It can be observed that the RiskScore in Cluster1 samples was generally greater than that in Cluster2 samples, whereas the OS in Cluster1 samples was remarkably lower than that in Cluster2, suggesting that samples with a high RiskScore had a poorer prognosis. Further, survivalROC of the R software package was adopted to perform ROC analysis of the prognostic classification of RiskScore. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-years prognosis prediction classification efficiencies were analyzed, as shown in  Figure 3B . It could be seen that the model demonstrated a high area under the curve (AUC), with an average value > 0.8.\n", "Functional Annotations of Prognosis-Specific Immune-Related Genes and Signaling Pathway Enrichment 1\nThe immune relationships among these 14 genes were then analyzed, as shown in  Table 3 . It could be observed that 8 (57%) were related to Cytokine_Receptors. Subsequently, clusterProfiler of the R software package was used to perform KEGG enrichment analysis of these 14 genes with a threshold of  p  < 0.05. Finally, 10 significantly enriched pathways were obtained, as presented in  Figure 4 .

The RiskScores among different stages were statistically significant, and a higher stage was associated with a higher RiskScore. Similar phenomena could also be observed for invasion degree and lymph node metastasis degree, which revealed that the RiskScore was potentially associated with the clinical stage.\n", "Furthermore, the stage was incorporated into the model to construct the multivariate regression model. The 5-year survival predicted ROC curves of the three single models, namely, stage, RiskScore, and stage+RiskScore, were compared as presented in  Figure 6A . Clearly, the AUC values followed the order stage+RiskScore > RiskScore > stage, and the stage+RiskScore value was significantly higher than those in the other two models. The respective median RiskScores of the three models were then used as thresholds to divide the samples into high- and low-risk groups, and a K-M curve was plotted, as shown in  Figures 6B-D . Obviously, the stage+RiskScore model was associated with the most significant difference in prognosis. Based on this, the clinical features including age, sex, T, N, and stage were combined with the RiskScore to construct the nomogram model and to plot the 1-, 3-, and 5-years survival predicted by the ROC curves ( Figures 7A-C ).\n", "Finally, the ssGSEA function of GSVA in the R software package was used to analyze the KEGG functional enrichment score of each sample in the training set. The respective correlations with RiskScores were also calculated based on the enrichment score of each pathway in each sample, and the top 20 most related KEGG pathways were selected. Clustering analysis was performed according to enrichment scores, as presented in  Figure 8A . Clearly, most samples were enriched in pathways closely correlated with tumorigenesis, such as P53, cell cycle, and DNA repair. These pathways could group the samples into two clusters, namely, Cluster1 and Cluster2. The RiskScore of Cluster2 was higher than that of Cluster1 and the RiskScore distribution of the two clusters was analyzed, as displayed in  Figure 8C . The RiskScore of Cluster2 samples was remarkably higher than that of Cluster1. Meanwhile, the correlations between these 20 pathways and RiskScore are presented in  Figure 8B . Based on this, seven pathways had a negative correlation, whereas 13 had a positive correlation, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.388.\n", "Test Set Sample Verification\nSubsequently, to further verify the stability and reliability of the prognostic prediction model, expression profile data of these 14 genes were extracted from the test set and substituted into the model for verification. The RiskScore of each sample was calculated, and the ROC curves were plotted based on these values; as presented in  Figure 9A , the AUC was > 0.7. Furthermore, the median was used to divide the samples into high- and low-risk groups and to analyze the difference in prognosis between the two groups, as presented in  Figure 9B . Clearly, there was a significant difference in prognosis between these two clusters with a  p -value of 0.00563. Moreover, the prognosis for low-risk samples was remarkably superior to that for the other samples, which was consistent with the training set data. In summary, the prognosis model constructed based on the expression profiles of these 14 prognosis-specific immune-related genes had high predictive accuracy and stability to identify immune features.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "6914845_Discussion", "text": ["\nEarly lung adenocarcinoma is associated with high risks of recurrence and death after surgery ( 20 ). However, patients cannot achieve consistent therapeutic benefits from certain drugs due to their potential toxicities and side effects, and as a result, the application of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery remains a source of controversy in clinics ( 21 ). Therefore, it is of importance to mine potential lung adenocarcinoma biomarkers that could be used to predict patient prognosis and recurrence, and to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from early adjuvant chemotherapy.\nIn the era of immunotherapy, it is of crucial significance to mine molecular events that are related to the tumor immune microenvironment to uncover predictive biomarkers associated with survival. The literature suggests that the FoxP3:CD3 ratio in the tumor matrix, as well as expression levels of IL-12 and IL-17, is markedly correlated with post-operative recurrence in early lung adenocarcinoma ( 22 - 24 ). Moreover, the infiltration of numerous immune factors and immunocytes (including neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) has also been reported to correlate with angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and invasion of this disease ( 25 ).\nIn this study, 14 prognosis-specific immune-related genes were discovered through the mining, statistical analysis, and sorting of large datasets such as TCGA and ImmPort. From this, a prognostic prediction model was constructed, the RiskScore of patients was calculated, and prediction and verification were also carried out. Among all 14 prognosis-specific immune-related genes, 9 (e.g.,  PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2 , and  THRB ) ( 26 - 34 ) have been reported to be involved in the immune microenvironment-associated pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma or suggested to be significant predictors of recurrence-free or overall survival. This implies that our bioinformatics analysis using TCGA and ImmPort cohorts has prognostic value. The remaining five genes have not been previously associated with lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and could serve as new potential biomarkers for this disease. These include  IL20RB  (interleukin 20 receptor beta),  LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17  (TNFR superfamily genes), and  MC1R  (melanocortin 1 receptor).\nWe are particularly interested in  TNFRSF1A  and  LTBR . From a protein-protein interaction network generated in the previous studies, both were found to be highly interconnected nodes. These two genes encode tumor necrosis factor receptors, which have been repeatedly shown to take part in multiple tumor processes such as proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. These receptors are not only expressed on some tumor cells but also on suppressive immune cells including regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. They convert the tumor-inhibitory TNF into a tumor-promoting factor, and not only directly enhance the proliferation of some types of tumor cells, but also activate immunosuppressive cells and support immune escape and tumor development ( 35 ,  36 ). In addition, these two markers can induce tumor-infiltrating T-cell apoptosis and contribute to failed patient responses to immunotherapy. These can also shape the tumor microenvironment via FasL/Fas-mediated cell apoptosis induced by other cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as cancer cells, endothelial cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( 37 ).\nPrevious reports have provided elegant analyses regarding how the activation of tumor-intrinsic genes shapes the tumor microenvironment. In the current work, the proposed model, constructed based on the expression profiles of specific immune-related genes, could further classify patients with defined clinical stages into different subgroups based on predicted survival. Moreover, the RiskScore, calculated based on the expression profiles of specific immune-related genes, could be used in combination with clinical features to predict the survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients more precisely. Although we used bioinformatics to identify prognosis-specific immune-related genes involved in lung adenocarcinoma, the limitations of this study should be noted.

However, patients cannot achieve consistent therapeutic benefits from certain drugs due to their potential toxicities and side effects, and as a result, the application of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery remains a source of controversy in clinics ( 21 ). Therefore, it is of importance to mine potential lung adenocarcinoma biomarkers that could be used to predict patient prognosis and recurrence, and to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from early adjuvant chemotherapy.\n", "In the era of immunotherapy, it is of crucial significance to mine molecular events that are related to the tumor immune microenvironment to uncover predictive biomarkers associated with survival. The literature suggests that the FoxP3:CD3 ratio in the tumor matrix, as well as expression levels of IL-12 and IL-17, is markedly correlated with post-operative recurrence in early lung adenocarcinoma ( 22 - 24 ). Moreover, the infiltration of numerous immune factors and immunocytes (including neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) has also been reported to correlate with angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and invasion of this disease ( 25 ).\n", "In this study, 14 prognosis-specific immune-related genes were discovered through the mining, statistical analysis, and sorting of large datasets such as TCGA and ImmPort. From this, a prognostic prediction model was constructed, the RiskScore of patients was calculated, and prediction and verification were also carried out. Among all 14 prognosis-specific immune-related genes, 9 (e.g.,  PSMD11, PPIA, MIF, BMP5, DKK1, PDGFB, ANGPTL4, IL1R2 , and  THRB ) ( 26 - 34 ) have been reported to be involved in the immune microenvironment-associated pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma or suggested to be significant predictors of recurrence-free or overall survival. This implies that our bioinformatics analysis using TCGA and ImmPort cohorts has prognostic value. The remaining five genes have not been previously associated with lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and could serve as new potential biomarkers for this disease. These include  IL20RB  (interleukin 20 receptor beta),  LTBR, TNFRSF1, TNFRSF17  (TNFR superfamily genes), and  MC1R  (melanocortin 1 receptor).\n", "We are particularly interested in  TNFRSF1A  and  LTBR . From a protein-protein interaction network generated in the previous studies, both were found to be highly interconnected nodes. These two genes encode tumor necrosis factor receptors, which have been repeatedly shown to take part in multiple tumor processes such as proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. These receptors are not only expressed on some tumor cells but also on suppressive immune cells including regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. They convert the tumor-inhibitory TNF into a tumor-promoting factor, and not only directly enhance the proliferation of some types of tumor cells, but also activate immunosuppressive cells and support immune escape and tumor development ( 35 ,  36 ). In addition, these two markers can induce tumor-infiltrating T-cell apoptosis and contribute to failed patient responses to immunotherapy. These can also shape the tumor microenvironment via FasL/Fas-mediated cell apoptosis induced by other cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as cancer cells, endothelial cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( 37 ).\n", "Previous reports have provided elegant analyses regarding how the activation of tumor-intrinsic genes shapes the tumor microenvironment. In the current work, the proposed model, constructed based on the expression profiles of specific immune-related genes, could further classify patients with defined clinical stages into different subgroups based on predicted survival. Moreover, the RiskScore, calculated based on the expression profiles of specific immune-related genes, could be used in combination with clinical features to predict the survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients more precisely. Although we used bioinformatics to identify prognosis-specific immune-related genes involved in lung adenocarcinoma, the limitations of this study should be noted. The proposed validation cohort is based on retrospective data from TCGA, so the models need further validation in large sample clinical studies.\n", "In conclusion, this model contributes new clinical lung adenocarcinoma markers.

The prevalence of GSD1 ranges from 1 in 20,000[ 2 ] to 1 in 400,000[ 3 ] depending on study and the ethnic background of subjects. GSD1 can be further divided into two categories, GSD1a, resulting from a mutation in the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 ( G6PC7 )[ 4 ], leading to a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic activity, and GSD1b, resulting from mutations in the glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) exchanger  SLC37A4 [ 4 ], blocking the transport of G6P into the endoplasmic reticulum. Both mutations lead to an inadequate conversion of G6P into glucose, impacting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, with subsequent hypoglycemia and buildup of glycogen and adipose tissue in liver and kidneys[ 4 ]. Clinical manifestations are typically noticeable after 3 to 4 months of age and include hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hypoglycemic seizures, and failure to thrive[ 1 ], [ 4 ]. Patients with GSD1 also suffer from short stature with thin extremities, delayed puberty and a protuberant abdomen caused by the massive hepatomegaly[ 4 ]. Interestingly, a significant number of patients with GSD1b suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), typically with a Crohn's disease phenotype[ 5 ], [ 6 ].\nA unique phenotype in patients with GSD1b is reoccurring infections, that traditionally have been attributed to either associated neutropenia or dysfunctional chemotaxis and intracellular bacterial killing of neutrophils. The cause of neutropenia in GSD1b patients remains unclear. Evidence suggests that the decreased neutrophil abundance and activity is a consequence of increased apoptosis of neutrophils in affected individuals[ 7 ]. However, the neutropenia alone cannot solely explain the immunodeficiency state in this disorder, since GCSF therapy doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of infections. Therefore, it is likely that the susceptibility to infections is likely attributed to additional effects on other immune subsets. As such, Melis and colleauges[ 8 ] were able to observe lymphopenia in patients with GSD1b, but not in GSD1a patients, with a reduction in CD4 +  T cells, CD8 +  T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, compared to controls.\nWe hypothesized that patients with GSD1b exhibit a broad range of immune dysregulation, beside in the neutrophil compartment, leading to an immunodeficiency phenotype with inflammatory features.

{"doc_key": "9980199_Results", "text": ["\nPatient cohort\nWe enrolled 6 patients with GSD1b and 3 controls for this study. Gender, age, inflammatory condition, current medications, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and c-reactive protein (CRP) levels are provided in  Table 1 . A deleterious mutation in  SLC37A4  gene was identified in all GSD1b patients ( Table 1 ), and all had an ANC below 1000 cells/ mm 3 , indicative of neutropenia. The average age for the control group was 16.3 years compared to 8.2 years for the GSD1b patients (p = 0.039). Two GSD1b patients also had concurrent IBD, and two patients had signs of bronchiectasis.\nReduction in total NK cells and macrophage/monocyte populations characterizes GSD1b\nTo characterize the immune landscape of the peripheral blood of patients with GSD1b vs. controls, we subjected all leukocytes (CD45+ cells) to unsupervised Rphenograph clustering. Automated clustering of the CD45+ populations identified 33 unique populations. The clusters were manually annotated based on average expression values of each marker in each cluster of combined patient samples displayed in the expression heatmap generated by cytofkit2 ( Fig. 1A ). Utilizing this method, we were able to identify multiple clusters of naive T cells including: CD4 +  T helper (T h ) cells, CD25 hi CD127 lQ  regulatory T cells (T reg ), CD4 CD8 double neg (DN) T cells, CD8 +  cytotoxic T cells (T c ), a population of activated and non-activated T cells and memory T cells. The B cell compartment was represented by na\u00efve B cells, pro-B cell, activated B cells, plasma cells (PC) and anergic B cells. The innate compartment accessible with our methodology consisted of classical pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages (M\u03a6>), CD16 high  and CD16 low  monocytes, monocyte precursors, CD15 high  and CD15 low  neutrophils, CD16 high  and CD16 low  NK cells, a small granulocyte population (Basophil, Neutrophil, Neutrophil - myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)), and innate lymphoid cells (ILC) ( Fig. 1A - C ). Cluster 32 could not be assigned to a known immune population because of its atypical high expression of CD11c, CD3 and CD19 and likely represented an immune aggregate or an artifact of unsupervised clustering. Given the low overall abundance of this cluster (0.095% in GSD1b cases and 0.13% in controls), it was labeled as unidentified and excluded from further analysis.\nTo get an overview of the obtained data and determine the differences in the composition of major immune subtypes, the identified clusters were then arranged into superclusters based on their marker similarities ( Fig. 1B - C ). There was a significant reduction in NK cells (combined clusters 7 and 25; fold change GSD1b/control 0.395, p value = 0.0375) and myeloid cells (M\u03a6 & monocyte cells, combined clusters 6, 17, 20, 24, 26, and 30; fold change GSD1b/control 0.419, p value = 0.0049) in GSD1b patients ( Fig. 1B ). No significant changes were observed in the remaining superclusters that included naive T cells (clusters 2, 4, 5, 10, 16, and 33), memory T cells (8, 11, 14, and 27), na\u00efve B cells (1, 15, 21, and 32), B cells (9, 12, 22, and 23), NKT cells (3), granulocytes (13, 18, 28, and 19) and ILC (29 and 31) ( Fig. 1B ).\nNK and myeloid cell percentage changes in GSD1b are population specific\nWe then determined if there were significant changes at the cluster level. The analysis of innate cell demonstrated a significant reduction in clusters 6, consisting of anti-inflammatory M\u03a6, and cluster 17, CD16 high  monocytes ( Fig. 2A ). The large decrease in anti-inflammatory M\u03a6 observed may explain the overall decrease in the M\u03a6 & monocyte population described above ( Fig. 1B ). For the NK populations, cluster 7, consisting of CD16 high  NK cells, was significantly reduced (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.39, p-value = 0.038, resulting in a global decrease in the number of NK cells,  Fig. 1B ,  Fig. 2A ,  Fig. 2C ). The loss of CD16 expression on NK cells is usually associated with their activation[ 13 ] and cluster 7 CD16 high  NK showed significantly lower CD16 levels in GSD1b patients (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.496, p-value = 0.026), indicative of increased activation of NK cells. However, no relevant or significant increase was observed in CD16 low  NK clusters. While the overall neutrophil populations were similar between patients and controls, cluster 28, Neutrophil-MDSC, was significantly reduced in GSD1b patients (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.359, p-value = 0.0283,  Fig. 2B ). Nevertheless, assessment of the neutrophilic compartment after a gradient preparation is of limited value and may not provide an accurate estimation of cell composition.\nGSD1b patients exhibit high central memory and low effector memory T cells levels\nOn the adaptive immunity side, two T cell clusters were altered between GSD1b subjects and controls. Cluster 11, representing central memory T helper 1 cells (cmT h 1), was increased (fold change GSD1b/control = 3.54, p-value = 0.015,  Fig. 2A ), while cluster 27, effector memory cytotoxic T cells (emT c ), was reduced in GSD1b patients (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.09, p = 0.043,  Fig. 2A ), potentially indicating a dysregulated switch from effector memory to central memory T cells. Moreover, the ratios of central memory T cells (clusters 8 and 11, annotation based on: CD45RA -  CD45RO +  CCR7 +  expression) to effector memory T cells (clusters 14 and 27; annotation based on: CD45RA -  CD45RO +  CCR7 - expression)[ 14 ] in healthy controls and GSD1b was 3.4 times higher in patients with GSD1b, with a confidence interval of 94.61% (p = 0.054,  Fig. 2B ). Additionally, we observed a trend in the overall reduction of memory T cells and an increase in naive T cells in the GGD1b subjects with an increase in the ratio of naive to memory T cells in GSD1b subjects ( Fig. 2A ,  Fig. 2B ).\nGlobal downregulation of myeloid markers and upregulation of CXCR3 in GSD1b\nTo assess differential expression of surface markers between the groups, we evaluated the MMI in all the clusters and plotted changes found significant in  Fig. 3A  ( Supplementary Figure S1B  shows all marker fold changes). Although every cluster demonstrated some differences in marker expression between the two groups and almost all markers were altered in at least some of the clusters, we identified a few markers that were consistently downregulated in a majority of clusters among patients with GSD1b, including CD123 (IL-3R\u03b1), CD14 (receptor for lipopolysaccharide-lipopolysaccharide [LPS] binding protein complex), CCR4 (receptor for CCL17 and CCL22), CD24 (ligand of P-selectin, SELP), CD11b (myeloid lineage marker, subunit of integrin CR3) and CD127 (IL-7R). Interestingly, CXCR3 (Receptor for CXCL9, 10, 11), which is involved in trafficking of effector T cells, was significantly upregulated across multiple clusters ( Fig. 3B ) in GSD1b patients.\nIn addition, cluster 6, consisting of anti-inflammatory M\u03a6, exhibited decreased expression of CD163 (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.54, p-value = 0.002,  Fig. 3A ). CD163 is a cysteine-rich scavenger receptor on monocyte lineage cells involved in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis and has been shown to be strongly downregulated on M\u03a6 and Monocytes in response to proinflammatory signalling[ 15 ], which may be consistent with the findings in the GSD1b patients, and may indicate impaired function of this anti-inflammatory macrophage subset. Cluster 27, activated emT c , showed higher expression of CXCR3 (fold change GSD1b/control = 1.78, p-value = 0.01,  Fig. 3A ), which is considered to represent an activation marker for CD8 +  T cells; for this effector memory T cell population, it likely indicates activation and targeting to sites of infection[ 16 ]. The largest observed neutrophil population, cluster 18, CD15 high -expressing cells, had an increase in MMI for CD45RO (fold change GSD1b/control = 1.763=, p-value = 0.02,  Fig. 3A ) and a decrease for CD45RA (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.735, p-value = 0.03,  Fig. 3A ). CD45RO is usually found on non-activated, resting neutrophils, while CD45RA is considered a marker of activation[ 17 ], which may suggest that this neutrophil population is less activated in GSD1b patients.\n"], "ner": [[[44, 49, "DISEASE"], [237, 257, "RELATION"], [262, 269, "GENE"], [298, 303, "DISEASE"], [480, 485, "DISEASE"], [512, 517, "DISEASE"], [547, 550, "DISEASE"], [582, 596, "DISEASE"]], [[676, 681, "DISEASE"], [760, 765, "DISEASE"], [809, 813, "GENE"], [890, 894, "GENE"], [1239, 1242, "GENE"], [1269, 1273, "GENE"], [1277, 1282, "GENE"], [1316, 1319, "GENE"], [1320, 1323, "GENE"], [1349, 1352, "GENE"], [1705, 1709, "GENE"], [1720, 1724, "GENE"], [1762, 1766, "GENE"], [1777, 1781, "GENE"], [1800, 1804, "GENE"], [1815, 1819, "GENE"], [2098, 2103, "GENE"], [2105, 2108, "GENE"], [2113, 2117, "GENE"], [2263, 2268, "DISEASE"]], [[2682, 2687, "DISEASE"], [2818, 2823, "DISEASE"]], [[3244, 3249, "DISEASE"], [3481, 3485, "GENE"], [3710, 3714, "GENE"], [3770, 3775, "DISEASE"], [3913, 3917, "GENE"], [4005, 4009, "GENE"], [4046, 4050, "GENE"], [4061, 4066, "GENE"], [4239, 4243, "GENE"], [4405, 4410, "DISEASE"]], [[4656, 4661, "DISEASE"], [4810, 4815, "DISEASE"], [4934, 4939, "DISEASE"], [5062, 5067, "DISEASE"], [5494, 5499, "DISEASE"], [5538, 5543, "DISEASE"], [5723, 5728, "DISEASE"], [5798, 5803, "DISEASE"]], [[5882, 5894, "RELATION"], [5898, 5903, "GENE"], [5907, 5912, "DISEASE"], [6356, 6369, "RELATION"], [6416, 6421, "DISEASE"], [6433, 6438, "GENE"], [6449, 6453, "GENE"], [6538, 6542, "GENE"], [6557, 6562, "GENE"], [6567, 6572, "GENE"], [6575, 6579, "GENE"], [6610, 6615, "GENE"], [6670, 6675, "GENE"], [6677, 6682, "GENE"], [6700, 6705, "GENE"], [6720, 6725, "GENE"], [6808, 6819, "RELATION"], [6860, 6865, "DISEASE"]], [[6970, 6975, "GENE"], [6989, 6994, "DISEASE"], [7040, 7045, "GENE"], [7329, 7334, "DISEASE"], [7483, 7488, "GENE"], [7610, 7613, "GENE"], [7800, 7804, "GENE"], [7876, 7881, "DISEASE"], [7946, 7952, "GENE"], [7966, 7971, "GENE"], [8208, 8213, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[262, 269, 298, 303, "causative mutation"]], [], [], [], [], [[5898, 5903, 5907, 5912, "increased expression"], [6433, 6438, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6449, 6453, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6538, 6542, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6557, 6562, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6567, 6572, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6575, 6579, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6610, 6615, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6670, 6675, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6677, 6682, 6416, 6421, "decreased expression"], [6700, 6705, 6860, 6865, "increased expression"]], []], "triplets": [[[262, 269, 298, 303, 237, 257]], [], [], [], [], [[5898, 5903, 5907, 5912, 5882, 5894], [6433, 6438, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6449, 6453, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6538, 6542, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6557, 6562, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6567, 6572, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6575, 6579, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6610, 6615, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6670, 6675, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6677, 6682, 6416, 6421, 6356, 6369], [6700, 6705, 6860, 6865, 6808, 6819]], []], "triplets_text": [[["SLC37A4", "GSD1b", "deleterious mutation"]], [], [], [], [], [["CXCR3", "GSD1b", "upregulation"], ["CD123", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CD14", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CCR4", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CCL17", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CCL22", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CD24", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CD11b", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CD127", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["IL - 7R", "GSD1b", "downregulated"], ["CXCR3", "GSD1b", "upregulated"]], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "sentences": ["\nPatient cohort\nWe enrolled 6 patients with GSD1b and 3 controls for this study. Gender, age, inflammatory condition, current medications, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and c-reactive protein (CRP) levels are provided in  Table 1 . A deleterious mutation in  SLC37A4  gene was identified in all GSD1b patients ( Table 1 ), and all had an ANC below 1000 cells/ mm 3 , indicative of neutropenia. The average age for the control group was 16.3 years compared to 8.2 years for the GSD1b patients (p = 0.039). Two GSD1b patients also had concurrent IBD, and two patients had signs of bronchiectasis.\n", "Reduction in total NK cells and macrophage/monocyte populations characterizes GSD1b\nTo characterize the immune landscape of the peripheral blood of patients with GSD1b vs. controls, we subjected all leukocytes (CD45+ cells) to unsupervised Rphenograph clustering. Automated clustering of the CD45+ populations identified 33 unique populations. The clusters were manually annotated based on average expression values of each marker in each cluster of combined patient samples displayed in the expression heatmap generated by cytofkit2 ( Fig. 1A ). Utilizing this method, we were able to identify multiple clusters of naive T cells including: CD4 +  T helper (T h ) cells, CD25 hi CD127 lQ  regulatory T cells (T reg ), CD4 CD8 double neg (DN) T cells, CD8 +  cytotoxic T cells (T c ), a population of activated and non-activated T cells and memory T cells. The B cell compartment was represented by na\u00efve B cells, pro-B cell, activated B cells, plasma cells (PC) and anergic B cells. The innate compartment accessible with our methodology consisted of classical pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages (M\u03a6>), CD16 high  and CD16 low  monocytes, monocyte precursors, CD15 high  and CD15 low  neutrophils, CD16 high  and CD16 low  NK cells, a small granulocyte population (Basophil, Neutrophil, Neutrophil - myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)), and innate lymphoid cells (ILC) ( Fig. 1A - C ). Cluster 32 could not be assigned to a known immune population because of its atypical high expression of CD11c, CD3 and CD19 and likely represented an immune aggregate or an artifact of unsupervised clustering. Given the low overall abundance of this cluster (0.095% in GSD1b cases and 0.13% in controls), it was labeled as unidentified and excluded from further analysis.\n", "To get an overview of the obtained data and determine the differences in the composition of major immune subtypes, the identified clusters were then arranged into superclusters based on their marker similarities ( Fig. 1B - C ). There was a significant reduction in NK cells (combined clusters 7 and 25; fold change GSD1b/control 0.395, p value = 0.0375) and myeloid cells (M\u03a6 & monocyte cells, combined clusters 6, 17, 20, 24, 26, and 30; fold change GSD1b/control 0.419, p value = 0.0049) in GSD1b patients ( Fig. 1B ). No significant changes were observed in the remaining superclusters that included naive T cells (clusters 2, 4, 5, 10, 16, and 33), memory T cells (8, 11, 14, and 27), na\u00efve B cells (1, 15, 21, and 32), B cells (9, 12, 22, and 23), NKT cells (3), granulocytes (13, 18, 28, and 19) and ILC (29 and 31) ( Fig. 1B ).\n", "NK and myeloid cell percentage changes in GSD1b are population specific\nWe then determined if there were significant changes at the cluster level. The analysis of innate cell demonstrated a significant reduction in clusters 6, consisting of anti-inflammatory M\u03a6, and cluster 17, CD16 high  monocytes ( Fig. 2A ). The large decrease in anti-inflammatory M\u03a6 observed may explain the overall decrease in the M\u03a6 & monocyte population described above ( Fig. 1B ). For the NK populations, cluster 7, consisting of CD16 high  NK cells, was significantly reduced (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.39, p-value = 0.038, resulting in a global decrease in the number of NK cells,  Fig. 1B ,  Fig. 2A ,  Fig. 2C ). The loss of CD16 expression on NK cells is usually associated with their activation[ 13 ] and cluster 7 CD16 high  NK showed significantly lower CD16 levels in GSD1b patients (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.496, p-value = 0.026), indicative of increased activation of NK cells. However, no relevant or significant increase was observed in CD16 low  NK clusters. While the overall neutrophil populations were similar between patients and controls, cluster 28, Neutrophil-MDSC, was significantly reduced in GSD1b patients (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.359, p-value = 0.0283,  Fig. 2B ). Nevertheless, assessment of the neutrophilic compartment after a gradient preparation is of limited value and may not provide an accurate estimation of cell composition.\n", "GSD1b patients exhibit high central memory and low effector memory T cells levels\nOn the adaptive immunity side, two T cell clusters were altered between GSD1b subjects and controls. Cluster 11, representing central memory T helper 1 cells (cmT h 1), was increased (fold change GSD1b/control = 3.54, p-value = 0.015,  Fig. 2A ), while cluster 27, effector memory cytotoxic T cells (emT c ), was reduced in GSD1b patients (fold change GSD1b/control = 0.09, p = 0.043,  Fig. 2A ), potentially indicating a dysregulated switch from effector memory to central memory T cells. Moreover, the ratios of central memory T cells (clusters 8 and 11, annotation based on: CD45RA -  CD45RO +  CCR7 +  expression) to effector memory T cells (clusters 14 and 27; annotation based on: CD45RA -  CD45RO +  CCR7 - expression)[ 14 ] in healthy controls and GSD1b was 3.4 times higher in patients with GSD1b, with a confidence interval of 94.61% (p = 0.054,  Fig. 2B ). Additionally, we observed a trend in the overall reduction of memory T cells and an increase in naive T cells in the GGD1b subjects with an increase in the ratio of naive to memory T cells in GSD1b subjects ( Fig. 2A ,  Fig. 2B ).\n", "Global downregulation of myeloid markers and upregulation of CXCR3 in GSD1b\nTo assess differential expression of surface markers between the groups, we evaluated the MMI in all the clusters and plotted changes found significant in  Fig. 3A  ( Supplementary Figure S1B  shows all marker fold changes).

{"doc_key": "9980199_Discussion", "text": ["\nTo date, the etiology of the immunodeficiency state and hyper-inflammatory intestinal condition observed in GSD1b remain unclear. Here, we utilize CyTOF technology to provide an in-depth overview of the innate and adaptive immune landscape in patients with GSD1b. Although our sample size was small, analysis of cell proportions in GSD1b patients showed little variability, indicating a robust assessment of significant changes not driven by variation within our groups. We were able to detect and assess 32 immune populations in both the innate and adaptive compartment, illuminating changes in GSD1b at a previously unprecedented depth.\nNeutropenia is a key characteristic in patients harboring mutations in patients harboring deleterious mutations in  SLC37A4  leading to GSD1b. Although blood sample processing using lymphoprep gradient eliminates most circulating neutrophils, we still found small remaining neutrophil populations that showed upregulation of CD45RO and downregulation of CD45RA in patients with GSD1b, indicating an impairment in neutrophil function or lack of activation. A link to increased apoptosis in these neutrophils has been suggested in the past, along with a possible inability to switch to a glycolytic metabolism after activation in a hypoglycemic environment[ 18 ]. Furthermore, we show major changes in other immune cell populations. In line with the findings of Melis  et al .[ 8 ] we observe a decrease in NK cells in GSD1b patients. The mechanism how GSD1b causes NK cell reduction is unclear, but might also be related to impaired glycolytic function in a hypoglycemic enviorment[ 19 ]. This is similar to the effect reported for lymphopenia and impairment of Warburg shift for T cells in GSD1b[ 8 ], although NK cells do not seem to undergo the switch to glycolytic energy generation as rapid as T cells[ 19 ]. As such, we observed a down-regulation in CD16 in NK cells in patients with GSD1b, likely due to the failure to sustain expansion and effector function in a hypoglycemic environment.\nThe strong reduction in anti-inflammatory M\u03a6 (M2-like) is not explainable with the hypoglycemic environment being insufficient for sustaining a stable population after activation, because anti-inflammatory M\u03a6 have been reported to rely mostly on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to meet their needs while also maintaining some glycolytic activity[ 20 ], [ 21 ]. However, it is difficult to determine the association between the inflammatory state (M1-/M2-like) and effect of M\u03a6 based on their surface marker expression (HLA-DR high  vs. HLA-DR low  in our case) alone. Some M\u03a6 populations (e.g. M1-like) are known to undergo a switch to Warburg metabolism[ 20 ], [ 21 ]. Further characterization of M\u03a6 populations, inflammatory status, and mode of activation in GSD1b patients might therefore be required.\nWe also observed a trend of increasing percentages of na\u00efve T cells in GSD1b, consistent with the observation by Melis  et al . of T cell dysregulation due to an impairment in glycolysis. However, we could not confirm their observation of a reduction in overall memory T cell levels. More striking is the observed transition from effector memory to central memory in T cells, a change that is predicted to result from the Warburg shift. Effector memory T cells, especially emT c  (cluster 27), were significantly reduced in GSD1b and, in contrast to cm T cells, are reported to rely heavily on glycolysis to meet their energy needs[ 22 ]-[ 24 ]. On the contrary, central memory T cells (cluster 11) were significantly increased in GSD1b and are reported to preferably perform oxidative phosphorylation, mainly fueled by fatty acid oxidation.[ 22 ]-[ 24 ] Our data shows a shift away from effector memory and towards the central memory T cell populations in GSD1b, which can be explained by the hypoglycemic conditions and impaired glycolysis in GSD1b favoring central memory over effector memory T cell phenotype.\nWe observed no significant changes in the B cell compartment similar to Melis  et al .[ 8 ]. Naive B cells rely on OXPHOS with only a moderate increase of glycolysis upon activation[ 25 ], [ 26 ], explaining their ability to differentiate and form stable effector and memory populations, even in hypoglycemic conditions.\nThe reason for the global downregulation of myeloid markers in GSD1b remains unclear. The upregulation of CXCR3 in multiple clusters might indicate increased activation and targeting to inflamed tissue in GSD1b, especially the lung[ 27 ].\nAlthough one explanation of the altered immune landscape is the hypoglycemia environment, this by itself cannot solely explain the immune phenotype observed in patients with GSD1b. An important comparison should be made to patients with GSD1a, resulting from  G6PC  mutations, that also suffer from severe recurrent hypoglycemia, but do not develop neutropenia or IBD.

{"doc_key": "6995577_3. Results", "text": ["\n3.1. BME Prevented TTR Amyloid Fibril Formation\nAmyloidogenesis and fibril formation by TTR is closely associated with the development of the devastating clinical features that characterize ATTR amyloidosis. In order to determine whether BME is able to modulate TTR amyloidogenesis, we accessed its effect on human TTR fibrillation in vitro using acid-mediated aggregation and fibril formation assay. In vitro, human TTR is capable of forming mature amyloid fibrils under mildly acidic conditions at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C. As revealed by the TEM image in  Figure 1 A, human TTR did not only form amorphous aggregates, but also formed mature amyloid fibrils after incubation for 14 days in the absence of BME ( Figure 1 B). Notably, in the presence of 20 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME (concentration of human TTR was 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L) no oligomers nor fibrils were observed as shown in  Figure 1 B. From these results, it can be inferred that BME inhibited human TTR aggregation and fibril formation.\n3.2. Effect of Native TTR Stability under Urea-Induced Denaturation Stress\nSince tetramer dissociation into monomers is the required and rate-limiting step in TTR amyloidogenesis we speculated that BME might have an effect on native TTR dissociation given its inhibition of fibril formation. Thus, we determined the effect of BME on human TTR and L55P TTR resistance to urea-mediated denaturation stress as described in the Materials section. As shown in  Figure 2 A (and its representative Tricine-SDS-PAGE image,  Figure 2 C), in the absence, but not in the presence of BME, human TTR was substantially dissociated after 72 h of incubation in 6 M urea at 4 \u00b0C. The percent of folded human TTR (i.e., tetramers, trimers and dimers) left after denaturation stress was higher in the presence of 13.33 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME (106 \u00b1 4.77) compared to in its absence (73.49 \u00b1 2.06). Quantitatively the percentage of folded human TTR left after denaturation in BME was not different from that of the control. Correspondingly, there was no formation of human TTR monomers in the presence but not in the absence of BME as indicated by the lack of appearance of the 16 kDa protein band on the gel ( Figure 2 C). The same trend of results was observed when L55P TTR was subjected to urea mediated denaturation with or without 13.33 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME ( Figure 2 B,C), however, dissociation of L55P TTR was not completely abrogated by BME as indicated by the presence of protein bands around 14-20 kDa corresponding to monomers. These results thus suggest that BME mitigated the dissociation of both human TTR and L55P TTR into monomers.\n3.3. Effect of Human TTR Tetramer Stability under Mildly Acidic Denaturation Condition\nTTR undergoes amyloidogenesis in vitro under mildly acid pH. However, this process requires the dissociation of native TTR tetramers into monomers which are susceptible to amyloidogenic transformation by partial unfolding. To ascertain the effect of BME on human TTR stability under acid-mediated denaturation conditions, the amount of tetramer left after aging the protein for 14 days with or without BME was quantified as described in above. As shown in  Figure 3 , incubation of human TTR under mild acidity markedly reduced the percentage of tetramers in the absence but not in the presence of 20 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME. Correspondingly, the content of monomers produced due to acid mediated denaturation of human TTR was higher in the absence than in the presence of BME as revealed by the monomer band intensity ( Figure 3 B). These results suggest that BME mitigated human TTR tetramer dissociation under mildly acidic conditions and further supports the earlier results observed under urea mediated denaturation conditions.\n3.4. Impact of BME on TTR Quaternary Structural Stability and Dose-Dependent Effect\nAs earlier stated, the key to TTR amyloidogenesis is its transition from tetramer to monomer, thus the stability of the native tetramer is crucial in mitigating its amyloidogenesis. To determine the effect of BME on the quaternary structural stability of human TTR, the protein solution with or without the extract was subjected to urea mediated denaturation stress followed by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay gives a reflection of the protein in its different conformations upon resolving on Tricine-SDS-PAGE [ 25 ]. As shown in  Figure 4 , the human TTR solution with or without BME after denaturation stress contained tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers, albeit in different proportions. In both the acid and urea mediated denaturation conditions ( Figure 4 A,B, respectively), the proportion of human TTR tetramer left at the end of the denaturation stress was greater in the presence than in the absence of BME as indicated by the protein band intensities. The opposite was reflected with regards to the proportion of monomers left, especially in the case of urea mediated denaturation ( Figure 4 B). However, based on the protein band intensities, the content of monomers left after acid mediated denaturation appear to be lesser in the absence of BME. Presumably, this may be due to their rapid conversion to amyloid competent species that are rapidly transformed into higher molecular weight aggregates and fibrils [ 26 ] as earlier shown in  Figure 1 . Thus, it is possible to deduce from these results that BME resisted the dissociation of TTR tetramer to monomers under tetramer-dissociating acid and urea mediated denaturation stress conditions.\nThe dose-dependent effect of BME on human TTR stability was determined by varying the concentrations of the extract in human TTR denaturation solution. As shown in  Figure 4 C, there was a substantially higher percentage of human TTR tetramers left after denaturation stress in the presence and not the absence of BME. However, the increase in the amount of human TTR in the presence of increasing amounts of BME was not remarkably different. These observations may be due to fact that the bioactive ligands responsible for tetramer stability was already saturated in its interactions with human TTR at every concentration of BME tested. These results thus seem to suggest that it is possible for BME to stabilize human TTR tetramer.\n3.5. Determination of Human TTR Amyloid Fibril Disrupting Activity of BME\nIn order to ascertain whether BME had any effect on already formed human TTR amyloid fibril, the soluble protein was first converted into mature fibrils by aging for 14 days in 200 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0 at 37 \u00b0C. Formation of mature human TTR amyloid fibrils was confirmed using TEM. The preformed human TTR fibrils was the co-incubated with or without BME at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 24 h. Thereafter, aliquot of the fibril solution was obtained and diluted by 100 times with Milli-Q water and spotted on formvar coated copper TEM grid followed by negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were later obtained. From the TEM images obtained ( Figure 5 ), it could be seen that the presence of BME did not alter the fibril morphology. There was no disruption in the mature preformed human TTR fibrils after 24 h of incubation of the given concentration of BME. Thus, it can be concluded that BME did not possess any fibril disrupting activity on mature human TTR fibrils.\n3.6. Determination of BME Binding to TTR\nBinding interaction between BME and human TTR was monitored using the small fluorescent probe ANS. ANS is very sensitive to the polarity of its environment. In aqueous environments, ANS has a weak fluorescence and displays an emission of maximum at 500 nm. Upon binding to the hydrophobic patches of proteins it produces a blue shift in its emission wavelength and an increase in its fluorescence intensity the extent of which is dependent on the protein structure and milieu surrounding ANS [ 27 ]. In the presence of human TTR tetramer, ANS binds specifically to the thyroxine-binding sites within the hydrophobic cavity with a consequent increase in fluorescence intensity at about 480 nm [ 28 ]. As shown in  Figure 6 , human TTR and ANS separately in phosphate buffer had very weak fluorescence intensities. However, upon co-incubation of human TTR and ANS in phosphate buffer, there was a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity. This can be attributed to the binding of ANS to the thyroxine-binding sites of human TTR tetramers as previously reported [ 7 , 28 ]. Interestingly, introduction of BME reduced the ANS fluorescence intensities dose-responsively. These seem to suggest that BME binds to the thyroxine binding sites of the tetramers and prevents ANS from its preferred binding location on the protein. Out of the hydrophobic T4-binding sites, ANS thus gives reduced fluorescence intensity.\n3.7. Chemical Characterization of BME\nThe major bioactive phytoconstituents in BME were determined by RP-HPC quantitative analysis as described in the Methods section. BME was found to contain Bacoside A (Bacoside A3 (2.22%  w / w ), Bacopaside II (4.68%  w / w ), Bacopaside X (3.25%  w / w )) and Bacopaside I (3.54%  w / w ), giving a total saponin content of 16.03%  w / w  of dried extract. Previously it had been reported that the total Bacoside A content of methanol extract of in vitro culture of  Bacopa monnieri  was 8.73 mg/g of dry weight [ 29 ]. The superior content of BME may be due to difference in our extraction method and solvent composition. BME contain over sixty individual compounds. The metabolite profile of saponins, phenolics, and other components present were previously determined by LC-ESI-qTOF-MS [ 15 ]. The total phenolic content of BME was also determined using the widely accepted Folin-Ciocalteu assay. BME recorded a phenolic content of 26.45 mg gallic acid equivalent/gram of dry weight. Compared to the phenolic content of thirty common culinary herbs in Thailand previously reported, BME had a higher phenolic content than twenty-three of them including  Cucurbita moschata  (pumpkin) leaves,  Allium sativum  (garlic) cloves,  Mentha canalenisa  (peppermint) leaves,  Curcuma longa  (turmeric) rhizome. However, the phenolic content of  Ocimum basilicum  (sweet basil) leaves,  Ocimum sanctum  (holy basil) leaves and  Acacia pennet a (acacia) shoot tips were higher than BME. Given that flavonoids constitute a major proportion of polyphenols in several plant species, the total flavonoid content in BME was determined and found to be 17.6 mg quercetin equivalent/g of BME [ 30 ].\nThe antioxidant capacity of BME was determined using DPPH and FRAP assays, two of the most commonly reported in vitro methods for ascertaining antioxidant content in fruits, vegetables, and plant-derived constituents. The FRAP assay measures the reductive ability of all the redox-active constituents in BME via single electron transfer (SET) mechanism while the DPPH assay determines radical scavenging activity of the extract toward the DPPH radical by SET and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms [ 31 ]. As shown in  Table 1 , BME had a FRAP value of 306.82 \u00b5mol Fe(II)/g, which is indicative of its ability to reduce ferric-TPTZ complex to its ferrous form.

Given that many of the health benefits associated with the consumption of fruits, vegetables and bioactives from plant sources have been attributed to antioxidants, it can be speculated that the presence these small-molecule natural antioxidant phenolics and saponins might be responsible for the anti-amyloidogenic properties of BME.\n"], "ner": [[[20, 23, "GENE"], [89, 92, "GENE"], [263, 266, "GENE"], [316, 319, "GENE"], [418, 421, "GENE"], [576, 579, "GENE"], [790, 793, "GENE"], [935, 938, "GENE"]], [[995, 998, "GENE"], [1132, 1135, "GENE"], [1206, 1209, "GENE"], [1312, 1315, "GENE"], [1325, 1328, "GENE"], [1556, 1559, "GENE"], [1664, 1667, "GENE"], [1885, 1888, "GENE"], [2013, 2016, "GENE"], [2213, 2216, "GENE"], [2340, 2343, "GENE"], [2547, 2550, "GENE"], [2560, 2563, "GENE"]], [[2600, 2603, "GENE"], [2666, 2669, "GENE"], [2785, 2788, "GENE"], [2929, 2932, "GENE"], [3154, 3157, "GENE"], [3371, 3374, "GENE"], [3533, 3536, "GENE"]], [[3707, 3710, "GENE"], [3799, 3802, "GENE"], [4030, 4033, "GENE"], [4359, 4362, "GENE"], [4617, 4620, "GENE"], [5362, 5365, "GENE"]], [[5512, 5515, "GENE"], [5595, 5598, "GENE"], [5700, 5703, "GENE"], [5834, 5837, "GENE"], [6066, 6069, "GENE"], [6190, 6193, "GENE"]], [[6232, 6235, "GENE"], [6351, 6354, "GENE"], [6521, 6524, "GENE"], [6586, 6589, "GENE"], [7090, 7093, "GENE"], [7260, 7263, "GENE"]], [[7310, 7313, "GENE"], [7356, 7359, "GENE"], [7839, 7842, "GENE"], [8044, 8047, "GENE"], [8164, 8167, "GENE"], [8343, 8346, "GENE"]], [], []], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], "sentences": ["\n3.1. BME Prevented TTR Amyloid Fibril Formation\nAmyloidogenesis and fibril formation by TTR is closely associated with the development of the devastating clinical features that characterize ATTR amyloidosis. In order to determine whether BME is able to modulate TTR amyloidogenesis, we accessed its effect on human TTR fibrillation in vitro using acid-mediated aggregation and fibril formation assay. In vitro, human TTR is capable of forming mature amyloid fibrils under mildly acidic conditions at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C. As revealed by the TEM image in  Figure 1 A, human TTR did not only form amorphous aggregates, but also formed mature amyloid fibrils after incubation for 14 days in the absence of BME ( Figure 1 B). Notably, in the presence of 20 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME (concentration of human TTR was 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L) no oligomers nor fibrils were observed as shown in  Figure 1 B. From these results, it can be inferred that BME inhibited human TTR aggregation and fibril formation.\n", "3.2. Effect of Native TTR Stability under Urea-Induced Denaturation Stress\nSince tetramer dissociation into monomers is the required and rate-limiting step in TTR amyloidogenesis we speculated that BME might have an effect on native TTR dissociation given its inhibition of fibril formation. Thus, we determined the effect of BME on human TTR and L55P TTR resistance to urea-mediated denaturation stress as described in the Materials section. As shown in  Figure 2 A (and its representative Tricine-SDS-PAGE image,  Figure 2 C), in the absence, but not in the presence of BME, human TTR was substantially dissociated after 72 h of incubation in 6 M urea at 4 \u00b0C. The percent of folded human TTR (i.e., tetramers, trimers and dimers) left after denaturation stress was higher in the presence of 13.33 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME (106 \u00b1 4.77) compared to in its absence (73.49 \u00b1 2.06). Quantitatively the percentage of folded human TTR left after denaturation in BME was not different from that of the control. Correspondingly, there was no formation of human TTR monomers in the presence but not in the absence of BME as indicated by the lack of appearance of the 16 kDa protein band on the gel ( Figure 2 C). The same trend of results was observed when L55P TTR was subjected to urea mediated denaturation with or without 13.33 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME ( Figure 2 B,C), however, dissociation of L55P TTR was not completely abrogated by BME as indicated by the presence of protein bands around 14-20 kDa corresponding to monomers. These results thus suggest that BME mitigated the dissociation of both human TTR and L55P TTR into monomers.\n", "3.3. Effect of Human TTR Tetramer Stability under Mildly Acidic Denaturation Condition\nTTR undergoes amyloidogenesis in vitro under mildly acid pH. However, this process requires the dissociation of native TTR tetramers into monomers which are susceptible to amyloidogenic transformation by partial unfolding. To ascertain the effect of BME on human TTR stability under acid-mediated denaturation conditions, the amount of tetramer left after aging the protein for 14 days with or without BME was quantified as described in above. As shown in  Figure 3 , incubation of human TTR under mild acidity markedly reduced the percentage of tetramers in the absence but not in the presence of 20 \u00b5g/\u00b5L BME. Correspondingly, the content of monomers produced due to acid mediated denaturation of human TTR was higher in the absence than in the presence of BME as revealed by the monomer band intensity ( Figure 3 B). These results suggest that BME mitigated human TTR tetramer dissociation under mildly acidic conditions and further supports the earlier results observed under urea mediated denaturation conditions.\n", "3.4. Impact of BME on TTR Quaternary Structural Stability and Dose-Dependent Effect\nAs earlier stated, the key to TTR amyloidogenesis is its transition from tetramer to monomer, thus the stability of the native tetramer is crucial in mitigating its amyloidogenesis. To determine the effect of BME on the quaternary structural stability of human TTR, the protein solution with or without the extract was subjected to urea mediated denaturation stress followed by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay gives a reflection of the protein in its different conformations upon resolving on Tricine-SDS-PAGE [ 25 ]. As shown in  Figure 4 , the human TTR solution with or without BME after denaturation stress contained tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers, albeit in different proportions. In both the acid and urea mediated denaturation conditions ( Figure 4 A,B, respectively), the proportion of human TTR tetramer left at the end of the denaturation stress was greater in the presence than in the absence of BME as indicated by the protein band intensities. The opposite was reflected with regards to the proportion of monomers left, especially in the case of urea mediated denaturation ( Figure 4 B). However, based on the protein band intensities, the content of monomers left after acid mediated denaturation appear to be lesser in the absence of BME. Presumably, this may be due to their rapid conversion to amyloid competent species that are rapidly transformed into higher molecular weight aggregates and fibrils [ 26 ] as earlier shown in  Figure 1 . Thus, it is possible to deduce from these results that BME resisted the dissociation of TTR tetramer to monomers under tetramer-dissociating acid and urea mediated denaturation stress conditions.\n", "The dose-dependent effect of BME on human TTR stability was determined by varying the concentrations of the extract in human TTR denaturation solution. As shown in  Figure 4 C, there was a substantially higher percentage of human TTR tetramers left after denaturation stress in the presence and not the absence of BME. However, the increase in the amount of human TTR in the presence of increasing amounts of BME was not remarkably different. These observations may be due to fact that the bioactive ligands responsible for tetramer stability was already saturated in its interactions with human TTR at every concentration of BME tested. These results thus seem to suggest that it is possible for BME to stabilize human TTR tetramer.\n", "3.5. Determination of Human TTR Amyloid Fibril Disrupting Activity of BME\nIn order to ascertain whether BME had any effect on already formed human TTR amyloid fibril, the soluble protein was first converted into mature fibrils by aging for 14 days in 200 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0 at 37 \u00b0C. Formation of mature human TTR amyloid fibrils was confirmed using TEM. The preformed human TTR fibrils was the co-incubated with or without BME at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 24 h. Thereafter, aliquot of the fibril solution was obtained and diluted by 100 times with Milli-Q water and spotted on formvar coated copper TEM grid followed by negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were later obtained. From the TEM images obtained ( Figure 5 ), it could be seen that the presence of BME did not alter the fibril morphology. There was no disruption in the mature preformed human TTR fibrils after 24 h of incubation of the given concentration of BME. Thus, it can be concluded that BME did not possess any fibril disrupting activity on mature human TTR fibrils.\n", "3.6. Determination of BME Binding to TTR\nBinding interaction between BME and human TTR was monitored using the small fluorescent probe ANS. ANS is very sensitive to the polarity of its environment. In aqueous environments, ANS has a weak fluorescence and displays an emission of maximum at 500 nm. Upon binding to the hydrophobic patches of proteins it produces a blue shift in its emission wavelength and an increase in its fluorescence intensity the extent of which is dependent on the protein structure and milieu surrounding ANS [ 27 ]. In the presence of human TTR tetramer, ANS binds specifically to the thyroxine-binding sites within the hydrophobic cavity with a consequent increase in fluorescence intensity at about 480 nm [ 28 ]. As shown in  Figure 6 , human TTR and ANS separately in phosphate buffer had very weak fluorescence intensities. However, upon co-incubation of human TTR and ANS in phosphate buffer, there was a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity. This can be attributed to the binding of ANS to the thyroxine-binding sites of human TTR tetramers as previously reported [ 7 , 28 ]. Interestingly, introduction of BME reduced the ANS fluorescence intensities dose-responsively. These seem to suggest that BME binds to the thyroxine binding sites of the tetramers and prevents ANS from its preferred binding location on the protein. Out of the hydrophobic T4-binding sites, ANS thus gives reduced fluorescence intensity.\n", "3.7. Chemical Characterization of BME\nThe major bioactive phytoconstituents in BME were determined by RP-HPC quantitative analysis as described in the Methods section. BME was found to contain Bacoside A (Bacoside A3 (2.22%  w / w ), Bacopaside II (4.68%  w / w ), Bacopaside X (3.25%  w / w )) and Bacopaside I (3.54%  w / w ), giving a total saponin content of 16.03%  w / w  of dried extract. Previously it had been reported that the total Bacoside A content of methanol extract of in vitro culture of  Bacopa monnieri  was 8.73 mg/g of dry weight [ 29 ]. The superior content of BME may be due to difference in our extraction method and solvent composition. BME contain over sixty individual compounds. The metabolite profile of saponins, phenolics, and other components present were previously determined by LC-ESI-qTOF-MS [ 15 ]. The total phenolic content of BME was also determined using the widely accepted Folin-Ciocalteu assay. BME recorded a phenolic content of 26.45 mg gallic acid equivalent/gram of dry weight. Compared to the phenolic content of thirty common culinary herbs in Thailand previously reported, BME had a higher phenolic content than twenty-three of them including  Cucurbita moschata  (pumpkin) leaves,  Allium sativum  (garlic) cloves,  Mentha canalenisa  (peppermint) leaves,  Curcuma longa  (turmeric) rhizome. However, the phenolic content of  Ocimum basilicum  (sweet basil) leaves,  Ocimum sanctum  (holy basil) leaves and  Acacia pennet a (acacia) shoot tips were higher than BME. Given that flavonoids constitute a major proportion of polyphenols in several plant species, the total flavonoid content in BME was determined and found to be 17.6 mg quercetin equivalent/g of BME [ 30 ].\n", "The antioxidant capacity of BME was determined using DPPH and FRAP assays, two of the most commonly reported in vitro methods for ascertaining antioxidant content in fruits, vegetables, and plant-derived constituents. The FRAP assay measures the reductive ability of all the redox-active constituents in BME via single electron transfer (SET) mechanism while the DPPH assay determines radical scavenging activity of the extract toward the DPPH radical by SET and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanisms [ 31 ]. As shown in  Table 1 , BME had a FRAP value of 306.82 \u00b5mol Fe(II)/g, which is indicative of its ability to reduce ferric-TPTZ complex to its ferrous form. The DPPH IC 50  value for BME was 90.89 mg/L. Konczak et al. observed a high degree of correlation between the FRAP value (in \u00b5mol Fe(II)/g dry weight) of commercially grown native Australian herbs and spices and their phenolic content (in mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight), which validated the notion that antioxidant capacity of bioactive components from food and plants is a function of their natural phenolic content [ 32 ]. Given that many of the health benefits associated with the consumption of fruits, vegetables and bioactives from plant sources have been attributed to antioxidants, it can be speculated that the presence these small-molecule natural antioxidant phenolics and saponins might be responsible for the anti-amyloidogenic properties of BME.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "6995577_4. Discussion", "text": ["\nThe objective of this work was to determine the ability of  Bacopa monnieri  extract (BME) to modulate transthyretin amyloidogenesis and fibril disaggregation in vitro. The results obtained strongly suggest that BME inhibited the formation of human TTR aggregates and mature fibril by stabilizing and preventing the dissociation of native tetramers through binding at the thyroxine-binding sites of the protein. However, BME could not disrupt preformed TTR fibrils. These findings suggest that BME contained bioactive metabolites with potential therapeutic implications for the modulation of ATTR amyloidosis.\nNormal physiological native TTR is made up of four identical monomers often annotated A-D. Each monomer is consisted of eight B-strands (A-H) and a short alpha helix, EF helix. Interaction between monomers via hydrogen bonds produces dimers. The dimers self-associate furnished by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions to form the functional tetramer which possesses a central hydrophobic channel that contains two binding sites for thyroxine (T4) created by amino acid residues from both dimers [ 33 ]. TTR is also capable of acquiring a gain-in-toxic function by becoming amyloidogenic in human [ 34 ]. Indeed, TTR amyloidogenesis is associated with the development of severe clinical complications including peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunctions, cardiomyopathy, or death in some cases, a condition which is generally referred to as ATTR amyloidosis. Unlike in several other similar multifactorial diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease where there are a lot of controversies surrounding their origin, in ATTR amyloidosis the consensus is that the key molecular event underpinning its etiopathogenesis is destabilization of the homotetrameric structure leading to its dissociation to monomers [ 1 ]. Given the pivotal role of tetramer dissociation in initiating the TTR amyloid cascade, there had been a strong momentum in research focused on the identification and development of kinetic stabilizers i.e., small-ligand agents which binds to (typically at the T4-binding sites) and prevents dissociation of tetrameric transthyretin [ 4 ]. The kinetic stabilization strategy led to the development of the regulatory approved drug Tafamidis, for the treatment of early-stage FAP [ 1 ] or cardiomyopathy of ATTRw amyloidosis. However, with limitations in Tafamidis such as its inability to prevent progression in neuropathy as well as its lack of effectiveness in late-stage TTR amyloidosis and nonV30M ATTRv amyloidosis [ 35 ], it is, therefore, vital to continue investigations aimed at identifying and developing effective and safe therapeutic alternatives.\nIn vitro, transthyretin is known to form amyloid fibrils under mildly acidic pH (5-4) at physiological temperature [ 36 ]. Using the well-established acid-mediated aggregation and fibril formation assay, we found that BME completely abrogated the formation of oligomers and mature amyloid fibrils by human TTR after 14 days of incubation as shown by the electron micrographs of the aged protein solutions. These findings are supported by earlier studies demonstrating the anti-amyloidogenic potential of BME on \u03b1-Synuclein [ 37 ]. Parkinson's disease is recently being considered as a type of amyloidosis-of which the main neuropathological diagnostic feature is the accumulation of cross-beta sheet-rich aggregates of \u03b1-Synuclein as Lewy bodies in the brain [ 38 ]. The crucial step in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is the aggregation of \u03b1-Synuclein [ 39 ], which is reportedly attenuated by  B. monnieri  extract [ 37 ]. However, unlike \u03b1-Synuclein and beta-amyloid which aggregate and form fibrils via a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism, TTR follows a downhill polymerization of amyloid competent monomers [ 40 ]. The implication here is that formation of these amyloidogenic monomers mandates the dissociation of tetramers-the critical step in TTR amyloidogenesis. Additionally, since this process is concentration-driven, a viable strategy to prevent the TTR amyloidogenesis and fibrillation would certainly involve preserving the quaternary structural integrity of tetramers [ 41 ]. Results from this study shows that BME indeed mitigated the urea-induced dissociation of human TTR and its most pathogenic variant L55P TTR, into their constituent monomers. These results were further supported by the resistance of human TTR in the presence but not in the absence of BME against acid-mediated denaturation and fibril formation. However, BME was incapable of disrupting preformed mature human TTR amyloid fibrils. These seem to suggest that the inhibition of human TTR fibril formation by BME was due to the prevention of the rate-limiting tetramer dissociation. Previous studies in the recent past have shown that natural products such as curcumin from  Curcuma longa  (Turmeric), propolis from honeybee were able to prevent the dissociation of TTR tetramers and, thus, modulate its amyloidogenesis [ 7 , 28 ]. The prevailing molecular mechanism, especially in the case of propolis involved the binding of the small-molecule ligand at the T4-binding site within the central hydrophobic channel of TTR tetramer with consequent increase in the tetramer stability. BME binds to and displaced the fluorescent probe ANS from the T4-binding sites in native tetrameric TTR as revealed by ANS displacement assay. The binding of BME at the T4-binding sites presumably creates further interactions between the dimers which might explain the plausible increase in stability of TTR tetramer observed in the glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay. This is supported by similar observations in several previous studies, i.e., increased TTR tetramer stability by binding of small-ligands at the T4-binding sites [ 7 , 19 , 28 , 42 ], as well as by mutations which fill the T4-binding cavity [ 3 ].\nBME possessed a high content of triterpenoid saponins as revealed by the RP-HPLC quantitative analysis, as well as phenolics, especially flavonoids. These findings were in accord with previous reports on the phytochemical constituents of  B. monnieri  extracts [ 15 ]. It is plausible that the tetramer stabilizing and anti-amyloidogenic effects of BME are due to the binding interactions mediated by these small-molecule ligands. In addition, BME also demonstrated a strong radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity. The radical scavenging effect of plant bioactives rich in phenolics is based on their ability to initiate single electro transfers, donate hydrogen atoms, or chelate transition metals [ 31 ]. In addition to BME binding directly and stabilizing TTR tetramers, its antioxidant bioactives might also be relevant in modulating TTR amyloidogenesis. For instance, it has been well reported that, similar to beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease and \u03b1-Synuclein in Parkinson's disease, TTR amyloidogenesis is also influenced by environmental or physiological factors, such as post-translational modifications [ 41 ]. This is supported by the fact that aging is the most relevant risk factor in these pathologies, and aging-associated oxidative modifications have been shown to modulate transthyretin amyloidogenesis and disease onset [ 43 ]. The free thiol group on Cys-10 residue has been shown to be one of the most susceptible free thiols in human plasma to oxidative modifications. Given its unique location close to the surface of the tetramer and near the thyroxine binding site, oxidative modifications of Cys-10 alters the structure of the homotetramer and reduces its stability [ 44 ]. The antioxidant and radical scavenging attributes of BME might provide an indirect protection on TTR by altering the redox potential of the milieu. A similar positive impact on TTR amyloidogenesis by natural agents with potent antioxidant activities had been previously observed in carvedilol, TUDCA, curcumin, and green tea extracts, which were shown to significantly reduce deposition of amyloid TTR despite their less impressive effect on tetramer stability [ 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Previous studies have reported the neuroprotective effects of  B. monnieri  in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [ 49 ], Parkinson's disease [ 37 ], and neurotoxicant-induced brain dysfunction [ 50 ]. Our investigation for the first time provides in vitro evidence for the protective role of BME in modulating transthyretin amyloidogenesis.\n"], "ner": [[[104, 117, "GENE"], [250, 253, "GENE"], [454, 457, "GENE"], [598, 609, "DISEASE"]], [[639, 642, "GENE"], [1121, 1124, "GENE"], [1230, 1233, "GENE"], [1253, 1284, "RELATION"], [1328, 1349, "DISEASE"], [1375, 1389, "DISEASE"], [1466, 1477, "DISEASE"], [1543, 1562, "DISEASE"], [1567, 1586, "DISEASE"], [1660, 1671, "DISEASE"], [1916, 1919, "GENE"], [2168, 2181, "GENE"], [2323, 2326, "DISEASE"], [2336, 2350, "DISEASE"], [2360, 2371, "DISEASE"], [2460, 2470, "DISEASE"], [2522, 2525, "GENE"], [2526, 2537, "DISEASE"], [2556, 2567, "DISEASE"]], [[2718, 2731, "GENE"], [3014, 3017, "GENE"], [3239, 3258, "DISEASE"], [3301, 3312, "DISEASE"], [3515, 3534, "DISEASE"], [3772, 3775, "GENE"], [3979, 3982, "GENE"], [4091, 4094, "GENE"], [4315, 4318, "GENE"], [4356, 4359, "GENE"], [4458, 4461, "GENE"], [4629, 4632, "GENE"], [4701, 4704, "GENE"], [4982, 4985, "GENE"], [5234, 5237, "GENE"], [5399, 5402, "GENE"], [5603, 5606, "GENE"], [5755, 5758, "GENE"]], [[6680, 6683, "GENE"], [6759, 6762, "GENE"], [6853, 6872, "DISEASE"], [6892, 6911, "DISEASE"], [6913, 6916, "GENE"], [7213, 7226, "GENE"], [7719, 7722, "GENE"], [7799, 7802, "GENE"], [8020, 8023, "GENE"], [8202, 8221, "DISEASE"], [8230, 8249, "DISEASE"], [8419, 8432, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [[1230, 1233, 1328, 1349, "pathological role"], [1230, 1233, 1375, 1389, "pathological role"], [1230, 1233, 1660, 1671, "pathological role"]], [], []], "triplets": [[], [[1230, 1233, 1328, 1349, 1253, 1284], [1230, 1233, 1375, 1389, 1253, 1284], [1230, 1233, 1660, 1671, 1253, 1284]], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [["TTR", "peripheral neuropathy", "associated with the development"], ["TTR", "cardiomyopathy", "associated with the development"], ["TTR", "amyloidosis", "associated with the development"]], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3], "sentences": ["\nThe objective of this work was to determine the ability of  Bacopa monnieri  extract (BME) to modulate transthyretin amyloidogenesis and fibril disaggregation in vitro.

However, unlike \u03b1-Synuclein and beta-amyloid which aggregate and form fibrils via a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism, TTR follows a downhill polymerization of amyloid competent monomers [ 40 ]. The implication here is that formation of these amyloidogenic monomers mandates the dissociation of tetramers-the critical step in TTR amyloidogenesis. Additionally, since this process is concentration-driven, a viable strategy to prevent the TTR amyloidogenesis and fibrillation would certainly involve preserving the quaternary structural integrity of tetramers [ 41 ]. Results from this study shows that BME indeed mitigated the urea-induced dissociation of human TTR and its most pathogenic variant L55P TTR, into their constituent monomers. These results were further supported by the resistance of human TTR in the presence but not in the absence of BME against acid-mediated denaturation and fibril formation. However, BME was incapable of disrupting preformed mature human TTR amyloid fibrils. These seem to suggest that the inhibition of human TTR fibril formation by BME was due to the prevention of the rate-limiting tetramer dissociation. Previous studies in the recent past have shown that natural products such as curcumin from  Curcuma longa  (Turmeric), propolis from honeybee were able to prevent the dissociation of TTR tetramers and, thus, modulate its amyloidogenesis [ 7 , 28 ]. The prevailing molecular mechanism, especially in the case of propolis involved the binding of the small-molecule ligand at the T4-binding site within the central hydrophobic channel of TTR tetramer with consequent increase in the tetramer stability. BME binds to and displaced the fluorescent probe ANS from the T4-binding sites in native tetrameric TTR as revealed by ANS displacement assay. The binding of BME at the T4-binding sites presumably creates further interactions between the dimers which might explain the plausible increase in stability of TTR tetramer observed in the glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay. This is supported by similar observations in several previous studies, i.e., increased TTR tetramer stability by binding of small-ligands at the T4-binding sites [ 7 , 19 , 28 , 42 ], as well as by mutations which fill the T4-binding cavity [ 3 ].\n", "BME possessed a high content of triterpenoid saponins as revealed by the RP-HPLC quantitative analysis, as well as phenolics, especially flavonoids. These findings were in accord with previous reports on the phytochemical constituents of  B. monnieri  extracts [ 15 ]. It is plausible that the tetramer stabilizing and anti-amyloidogenic effects of BME are due to the binding interactions mediated by these small-molecule ligands. In addition, BME also demonstrated a strong radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity. The radical scavenging effect of plant bioactives rich in phenolics is based on their ability to initiate single electro transfers, donate hydrogen atoms, or chelate transition metals [ 31 ]. In addition to BME binding directly and stabilizing TTR tetramers, its antioxidant bioactives might also be relevant in modulating TTR amyloidogenesis. For instance, it has been well reported that, similar to beta-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease and \u03b1-Synuclein in Parkinson's disease, TTR amyloidogenesis is also influenced by environmental or physiological factors, such as post-translational modifications [ 41 ]. This is supported by the fact that aging is the most relevant risk factor in these pathologies, and aging-associated oxidative modifications have been shown to modulate transthyretin amyloidogenesis and disease onset [ 43 ]. The free thiol group on Cys-10 residue has been shown to be one of the most susceptible free thiols in human plasma to oxidative modifications. Given its unique location close to the surface of the tetramer and near the thyroxine binding site, oxidative modifications of Cys-10 alters the structure of the homotetramer and reduces its stability [ 44 ]. The antioxidant and radical scavenging attributes of BME might provide an indirect protection on TTR by altering the redox potential of the milieu. A similar positive impact on TTR amyloidogenesis by natural agents with potent antioxidant activities had been previously observed in carvedilol, TUDCA, curcumin, and green tea extracts, which were shown to significantly reduce deposition of amyloid TTR despite their less impressive effect on tetramer stability [ 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Previous studies have reported the neuroprotective effects of  B. monnieri  in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [ 49 ], Parkinson's disease [ 37 ], and neurotoxicant-induced brain dysfunction [ 50 ]. Our investigation for the first time provides in vitro evidence for the protective role of BME in modulating transthyretin amyloidogenesis.\n"]}

Thereafter, protein solutions were subjected to denaturation by addition of acetate buffer, pH 4.0 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in the dark for 14 days. To determine the extent of denaturation, protein solutions were solubilized in SDS sample loading buffer without beta-mercaptoethanol (i.e., 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.1% bromophenol blue dye). Protein samples (without boiling) were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and separated bands were detected with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 staining.

Transthyretin pH-Induced Fibril Formation and Disruption Assays\nThe effect of BME on human TTR aggregation and fibril formation was determined by pre-incubating human TTR for 4 h with or without BME at 37 \u00b0C. Thereafter, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 with 200 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Aggregation of human TTR was enabled by aging the protein complex for 14 days in the dark at 37 \u00b0C under aseptic conditions. The extent of protein aggregation and fibrillation were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For TEM analysis, a drop of protein solution was spotted unto a formvar-coated copper grid for 3 min. Excess fluid was carefully blotted with a filter paper wedge. The grid was then rinsed with a drop of Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed by staining with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% methanol for 2 min. The grid was further rinsed with a drop of Milli-Q, excess fluid blotted away and dried at ambient temperature. The TEM image was obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010 (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) electron microscope operating at 160 kV. The fibril disruption assay was performed as previously described [ 6 ]. Preformed fibrils were prepared using acid-mediated aggregation assay and formation of fibrils was confirmed by TEM. The pre-formed fibrils were further incubated with or without BME in the dark at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h.

Aliquot of protein solution was obtained denaturation at stress. Glutaraldehyde was added to the protein solution (final concentration of 2.5%) and cross-linking allowed for 4 min at ambient temperature. Cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 7% NaBH 4  in 0.1 M NaOH (of equal volume to glutaraldehyde). The mixture was solubilized with 4\u00d7 SDS sample loading buffer (final SDS concentration of 2%) and boiled for 10 min before resolving on 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel. Protein bands were detected using Coomassie brilliant blue staining.\n2.8. Determination of Inhibitor Binding by ANS Displacement Fluorescence Assay\nThe small fluorescent probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS), is widely used in monitoring ligand or inhibitor binding to the thyroxine-binding site of native tetrameric TTR [ 23 ]. ANS binding assay was performed on Synergy HT (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA) microplate reader. The ANS stock solution (2.47 mM) was prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and its concentration was determined by absorbance (E 350  = 5000 M -1 cm -1 ) [ 24 ]. Human TTR (0.055 \u00b5g/\u00b5L) was incubated in the presence of 10 \u00b5M ANS and varying concentrations of BME (0.0055-0.55 \u00b5g/\u00b5L).

The protein was pre-incubated with BME, curcumin or DMSO (solvent) for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C in the dark. Urea solution was added to the protein solution (at a final concentration of 6 M) to initiate dissociation of the tetramers. Protein solution was incubated at 4 \u00b0C in the dark for 72 h. Thereafter, the amount of folded L55P TTR (i.e., dimers, trimmers, and tetramers) left was obtained by resolving the protein solution on 10% Tricine SDS-PAGE gel followed by densitometric analysis on LabWorks 4.0 software (UVP Ltd., Cambridge, UK) of the Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, stained protein bands on the gels. \n", "        \n\n           2.5.2.

The fraction of human TTR tetramers left after subjection to mild acid denaturation stress was quantified from the gel band intensities via densitometric analysis using gel documentation. Human TTR solution with or without BME was pre-incubated for 4 h to enable binding interactions. Thereafter, protein solutions were subjected to denaturation by addition of acetate buffer, pH 4.0 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in the dark for 14 days. To determine the extent of denaturation, protein solutions were solubilized in SDS sample loading buffer without beta-mercaptoethanol (i.e., 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.1% bromophenol blue dye). Protein samples (without boiling) were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and separated bands were detected with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 staining. In principle, under this SDS-PAGE condition, tetrameric transthyretin will be observed as SDS-resistant dimers on the gel [ \n        \n2.6. Transthyretin pH-Induced Fibril Formation and Disruption Assays\nThe effect of BME on human TTR aggregation and fibril formation was determined by pre-incubating human TTR for 4 h with or without BME at 37 \u00b0C. Thereafter, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 with 200 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Aggregation of human TTR was enabled by aging the protein complex for 14 days in the dark at 37 \u00b0C under aseptic conditions. The extent of protein aggregation and fibrillation were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For TEM analysis, a drop of protein solution was spotted unto a formvar-coated copper grid for 3 min. Excess fluid was carefully blotted with a filter paper wedge. The grid was then rinsed with a drop of Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) followed by staining with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% methanol for 2 min. The grid was further rinsed with a drop of Milli-Q, excess fluid blotted away and dried at ambient temperature. The TEM image was obtained using a JEOL JEM-2010 (JEOL Ltd., Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) electron microscope operating at 160 kV. The fibril disruption assay was performed as previously described [ 6 ]. Preformed fibrils were prepared using acid-mediated aggregation assay and formation of fibrils was confirmed by TEM. The pre-formed fibrils were further incubated with or without BME in the dark at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Thereafter, fibril disruption activity was confirmed by TEM and glutaraldehyde cross-linking assay followed by 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE.\n", "2.7. Transthyretin Quaternary Structural Alterations Determined by Glutaraldehyde Cross-Linking Assay\nThe quaternary structure of human TTR or L55P TTR subjected to urea-induced denaturation or human TTR after acid-mediated denaturation stress was determined by chemical cross-linking assay using glutaraldehyde. Aliquot of protein solution was obtained denaturation at stress. Glutaraldehyde was added to the protein solution (final concentration of 2.5%) and cross-linking allowed for 4 min at ambient temperature. Cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 7% NaBH 4  in 0.1 M NaOH (of equal volume to glutaraldehyde). The mixture was solubilized with 4\u00d7 SDS sample loading buffer (final SDS concentration of 2%) and boiled for 10 min before resolving on 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel. Protein bands were detected using Coomassie brilliant blue staining.\n", "2.8. Determination of Inhibitor Binding by ANS Displacement Fluorescence Assay\nThe small fluorescent probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS), is widely used in monitoring ligand or inhibitor binding to the thyroxine-binding site of native tetrameric TTR [ 23 ]. ANS binding assay was performed on Synergy HT (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA) microplate reader. The ANS stock solution (2.47 mM) was prepared in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and its concentration was determined by absorbance (E 350  = 5000 M -1 cm -1 ) [ 24 ]. Human TTR (0.055 \u00b5g/\u00b5L) was incubated in the presence of 10 \u00b5M ANS and varying concentrations of BME (0.0055-0.55 \u00b5g/\u00b5L). Fluorescence intensity was measured after 10 min at excitation of 360/40 nm and emission at 460/40 nm at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C.\n", "2.9. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with the aid of Graph Pad Prism version 7 for Microsoft windows (Graph Pad Software, San Diego CA, USA). The data was statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparison analysis using Tukey's test. Statistical significance was defined as *  p  < 0.05, **  p  < 0.01, and ***  p  < 0.001. All determinations were performed in triplicate and results represented as means \u00b1 SD.\n"]}
{"doc_key": "6995577_1. Introduction", "text": ["\nTransthyretin (TTR) is one of the most abundant plasma proteins and is involved in the transport of thyroxine and vitamin A [ 1 , 2 ]. In the cerebrospinal fluid, this 55 kDa homotetrameric protein synthesized in the choroid plexus is the main transporter of thyroxine (T4). Recent evidence seems to suggest a neuroprotective role of TTR in Alzheimer's disease. However, TTR in its pathological form, amyloid transthyretin (ATTR), is responsible for a spectrum of progressive, debilitating, life-altering neurodegenerative diseases known as ATTR amyloidosis which originated from the misfolding, mis-aggregation and systemic deposition of ATTR in several organs. ATTR amyloidosis is a severe clinical disorder leading to death in many cases within seven to ten years after the onset of clinical manifestations [ 1 ]. At the moment there is no cure for the disease and effective therapeutic interventions are very limited. Thus, there is a pressing need for investigations targeted toward the identification or development of safe and effective therapeutic interventions.\nNative wild-type TTR is fairly stable under physiological conditions but possesses an intrinsic propensity to dissociate into its monomeric form. This propensity is enhanced by single point mutations in the TTR gene leading to variant TTR with altered and often reduced quaternary structural stability. At the moment, there are over 130 variant forms of TTR, most of which are amyloidogenic. Systemic deposition of aggregated variant TTR as amyloid fibrils in various organs of the body constitutes the pathological hallmark of hereditary variant transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis, such as the formally known familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC). Deposition of wild-type transthyretin leads to wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) amyloidosis or the erstwhile senile systemic amyloidosis. ATTRwt amyloidosis is a leading cause of death in the elderly often involving heart failure [ 3 ]. While the complete picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition of normal soluble functional transthyretin into its pathological counterpart is still emerging, the prevailing hypothesis is that the initial and most important step is the dissociation of the native tetramer into monomers [ 1 ]. Thus, investigations involving the identification and development of small-molecule ligands that prevented tetramer dissociation, also known as kinetic stabilizers, were considered a viable therapeutic strategy [ 4 ]. The recent development of kinetic stabilizers, such as Tafamidis and diflunisal, in addition to TTR gene silencers, including Inotersen and Patisiran, has provided patients with some positive treatment outcomes. However, limitations involving the long-term consequences and failure to prevent neurologic impairment in patients remain major sources of concern [ 5 ]. The investigations into safe and effective alternative therapeutic agents for preventing TTR amyloidogenesis and/or disrupting the preformed fibrils (amyloid disrupters), therefore, are still required. Recently, natural products from plants have been receiving increasing attention for their anti-amyloid activities as well as alternative beneficial effects, such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and metal-chelating properties [ 6 , 7 , 8 ].\n  (L.)

Initial body weights were similar between the 3 groups: 194\u00b14 g (control), 195\u00b14 g (LipL32) and 191\u00b13 g (Lp25). Weight gain was lower in the LipL32 group (18\u00b13 g, p<0,05) and Lp25 group (13\u00b13 g, p<0,01) than the control group (28\u00b12 g) on day 5.  Fig 1  shows that the GFR, evaluated as creatinine clearance (CrCl), was significantly lower in the Lp25 group (0.47\u00b10.03 mL/min/100 gBW) than the control group (1.05\u00b10.13 mL/min/100 gBW) and LipL32 (0.87\u00b10.10 mL/min/100 gBW). The urinary volume was lower in the Lp25 group (12.0\u00b11.3 UV mL/12h) than the control group (23.0\u00b13.8 UV mL/12h) and the LipL32 group (17.3\u00b13.6 UV mL/12h). Notably, the serum potassium level in the Lp25 group (6.7\u00b10.5 mEq/L) was elevated, compared to the control group (4.7\u00b10.2 mEq/L) and the LipL32 group (5.7\u00b10.3 mEq/L). The fractional excretion of sodium was similar in the three groups (control 0.82\u00b10.18%; LipL32 0.60\u00b10.09%; Lp25 0.83\u00b1 0.15%).\nThe Lp25 group had significantly higher levels of serum CPK, phosphate and uric acid (2060\u00b1338 CPK U/L; 8.36\u00b10.32 P mg/dL and 2.75\u00b10.56 acid uric mg/dL) ( Fig 2 ). These parameters in the LipL32 group (726\u00b1216 CPK U/L; 6.70\u00b10.41 P mg/dL and 1.06\u00b10.28 acid uric mg/dL) were similar to the control group (763\u00b1197 CPK U/L; 7.06\u00b10.30 P mg/dL and 1.07\u00b10.20 acid uric mg/dL).\nAKI was observed in all animals of Lp25 group (100%) and 7/14 (50%) of these also had oliguria. In the LipL32 group, 2/13 animals (15.38%) had AKI oliguric and 1/13 (7.69%) presented AKI nonoliguric. Hyperkalemia was seen in 13/14 (92.85%) guinea pigs in the Lp25 group vs 8/13 (61.53%) in the LpL32 group.\nIn the Lp25 group, rhabdomyolysis, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia were encountered in 12/14 (85.71%), 10/14 (71.42%) and 9/14 (64.28%) animals, respectively. Seven animals of this group (50%) showed the three outcomes concomitantly. In the LipL32 group, 2/13 (15.38%) had rhabdomyolysis, 3/13 (23.07%) had hyperphosphatemia and 2/13 (15.38%) had hyperuricemia.\nLp25 induced muscular lesions that were more accentuated than LipL32\nWe performed immunohistological and morphological analyses to assess the effect of the LipL32 and Lp25 proteins on muscle tissues. The anti-rabbit Lp25 antibodies labeled isolated or small groups of muscular fibers with granular, faintly brownish antigen deposits that may partially delineate the sarcolemma and spread to the cytoplasm below ( Fig 3A ). The inflammatory infiltrate was generally discrete and primarily composed of small groups of monocytes that were present as focal isolated interstitial groups or small groups of isolated muscular fibers, frequently with antigenic linear deposits that partially circumscribed muscular fibers or inside their cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic antigenic granules were also detected occasionally in mononuclear phagocytic cells when the inflammatory infiltrate is more conspicuous. Immunohistochemistry with the anti-rabbit LipL32 antibodies was also positive on the sarcolemma and in the cytoplasm of isolated muscular fibers. Scarce mononuclear inflammatory interstitial reactions near the damaged muscle were also present ( Fig 3B ). Histological analyses of the muscle fragments revealed essentially similar muscular lesions were present in animals inoculated with both proteins, but with different degrees of severity ( Fig 3C-3H ). No wide range of muscular fiber sizes (small or large groups of atrophic or hypertrophic fibers) were observed in either protein group. Internal sarcolemmal nuclei were not detected in isolated muscle fibers. However, isolated nonspecific muscular lesions were present and ranged from hyaline contraction cytoplasmatic changes ( Fig 3E and 3F ) to small vacuoles, which may progress to hypercontracted isolated fibers to necrosis prior to phagocytosis ( Fig 3G ) or to intermediate damage, which was characterized by staining changes in myofibrils ( Fig 3F ), including the appearance of pale necrotic cells in H&E and Gomori trichrome stains (\"ghost cells \") ( Fig 3F and 3H ). Irregular areas of muscle necrosis were the end result of these muscular disturbances ( Fig 3C and 3D ). Mild inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages were also observed around necrotic areas. Fragments from the LipL32 group revealed essentially similar findings to the Lp25 group, but with less frequent focal muscular damage and areas of necrosis ( Fig 3D ).\nMuscular lesions severity scores were significantly lower (p<0.05) in the LipL32 group (0.66 \u00b1 0.21) than the Lp25 group (1.43 \u00b1 0.20), and no muscular lesions were observed in the control group. The difference between LipL32 and Lp25-inoculated animals was statistically significant (p<0.05, LipL32 vs. Lp25) ( Fig 4 ). Specifically, 53.85% of animals treated with LipL32 shown no muscular lesions, whereas the lesions of severity stage 1 and 2 were observed in 30.77% and 15.38%, respectively, of guinea pigs inoculated with this protein. Otherwise, all Lp25-inoculated animals presented muscular lesions, of these 42.86% had mild manifestations (stage 1) and 57.14% had severe signs (stage 2). Histological examination of the kidneys revealed no lesions ( S1 Fig ).\nLp25 protein is conserved in pathogenic strains of  Leptospira  spp.\nImmunoblots of whole cell lysates revealed that the Lp25 protein was expressed by all strains of pathogenic leptospires tested, and it was not detected in the non-pathogenic strain ( Fig 5A ). Equal results were obtained in immunoblot assays using LipL32 antiserum as a positive control and demonstrated that the Lp25 protein, like the LipL32 [ 25 ], was conserved and only found in pathogenic species of  Leptospira .\nLp25 is an outer membrane protein\nAll control proteins were detected in whole cell extracts. LigA was completely solubilized by the detergent and fractionated into the aqueous and detergent phases. LipL31 was detected in the insoluble pellet fraction and aqueous phase, and it was completely absent from the detergent phase ( Fig 5B ). We performed an additional experiment using the LipL32 antiserum because a previous work reported that LipL32 was solubilized by Triton X-114 and mostly detected in the detergent fraction [ 25 ].  Fig 5B  shows that the presence of LipL32 in the Triton X-114 fraction was confirmed [ 25 ]. These results demonstrated the correct functioning of the Triton X-114 fractionation method.\nWe also investigated the surface localization of Lp25 using proteolysis of intact cells of the  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 using proteinase K.  Fig 5C  shows that Lp25 was susceptible to protease treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and the subsurface LipL32 was not susceptible, which suggests that Lp25 is exposed on the surface. These results are consistent with a previously published study that demonstrated that LipL32 was not exposed on the leptospiral surface, despite its localization in the outer membrane [ 13 ].\n"], "ner": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], "sentences": ["\nLp25 is associated with rhabdomyolysis and oliguric acute kidney injury\nA total of 37 guinea pigs were assigned into one of three treatment groups: control (n = 10), LipL32 (n = 13) or Lp25 (n = 14).

The anti-rabbit Lp25 antibodies labeled isolated or small groups of muscular fibers with granular, faintly brownish antigen deposits that may partially delineate the sarcolemma and spread to the cytoplasm below ( Fig 3A ). The inflammatory infiltrate was generally discrete and primarily composed of small groups of monocytes that were present as focal isolated interstitial groups or small groups of isolated muscular fibers, frequently with antigenic linear deposits that partially circumscribed muscular fibers or inside their cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic antigenic granules were also detected occasionally in mononuclear phagocytic cells when the inflammatory infiltrate is more conspicuous. Immunohistochemistry with the anti-rabbit LipL32 antibodies was also positive on the sarcolemma and in the cytoplasm of isolated muscular fibers. Scarce mononuclear inflammatory interstitial reactions near the damaged muscle were also present ( Fig 3B ). Histological analyses of the muscle fragments revealed essentially similar muscular lesions were present in animals inoculated with both proteins, but with different degrees of severity ( Fig 3C-3H ). No wide range of muscular fiber sizes (small or large groups of atrophic or hypertrophic fibers) were observed in either protein group. Internal sarcolemmal nuclei were not detected in isolated muscle fibers. However, isolated nonspecific muscular lesions were present and ranged from hyaline contraction cytoplasmatic changes ( Fig 3E and 3F ) to small vacuoles, which may progress to hypercontracted isolated fibers to necrosis prior to phagocytosis ( Fig 3G ) or to intermediate damage, which was characterized by staining changes in myofibrils ( Fig 3F ), including the appearance of pale necrotic cells in H&E and Gomori trichrome stains (\"ghost cells \") ( Fig 3F and 3H ). Irregular areas of muscle necrosis were the end result of these muscular disturbances ( Fig 3C and 3D ). Mild inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages were also observed around necrotic areas. Fragments from the LipL32 group revealed essentially similar findings to the Lp25 group, but with less frequent focal muscular damage and areas of necrosis ( Fig 3D ).\n", "Muscular lesions severity scores were significantly lower (p<0.05) in the LipL32 group (0.66 \u00b1 0.21) than the Lp25 group (1.43 \u00b1 0.20), and no muscular lesions were observed in the control group. The difference between LipL32 and Lp25-inoculated animals was statistically significant (p<0.05, LipL32 vs. Lp25) ( Fig 4 ). Specifically, 53.85% of animals treated with LipL32 shown no muscular lesions, whereas the lesions of severity stage 1 and 2 were observed in 30.77% and 15.38%, respectively, of guinea pigs inoculated with this protein. Otherwise, all Lp25-inoculated animals presented muscular lesions, of these 42.86% had mild manifestations (stage 1) and 57.14% had severe signs (stage 2). Histological examination of the kidneys revealed no lesions ( S1 Fig ).\n", "Lp25 protein is conserved in pathogenic strains of  Leptospira  spp.\nImmunoblots of whole cell lysates revealed that the Lp25 protein was expressed by all strains of pathogenic leptospires tested, and it was not detected in the non-pathogenic strain ( Fig 5A ). Equal results were obtained in immunoblot assays using LipL32 antiserum as a positive control and demonstrated that the Lp25 protein, like the LipL32 [ 25 ], was conserved and only found in pathogenic species of  Leptospira .\n", "Lp25 is an outer membrane protein\nAll control proteins were detected in whole cell extracts. LigA was completely solubilized by the detergent and fractionated into the aqueous and detergent phases. LipL31 was detected in the insoluble pellet fraction and aqueous phase, and it was completely absent from the detergent phase ( Fig 5B ). We performed an additional experiment using the LipL32 antiserum because a previous work reported that LipL32 was solubilized by Triton X-114 and mostly detected in the detergent fraction [ 25 ].  Fig 5B  shows that the presence of LipL32 in the Triton X-114 fraction was confirmed [ 25 ]. These results demonstrated the correct functioning of the Triton X-114 fractionation method.\n", "We also investigated the surface localization of Lp25 using proteolysis of intact cells of the  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 using proteinase K.  Fig 5C  shows that Lp25 was susceptible to protease treatment in a dose-dependent manner, and the subsurface LipL32 was not susceptible, which suggests that Lp25 is exposed on the surface. These results are consistent with a previously published study that demonstrated that LipL32 was not exposed on the leptospiral surface, despite its localization in the outer membrane [ 13 ].\n"]}
{"doc_key": "5444857_Discussion", "text": ["\nThe renal manifestations of leptospirosis are variable and range from mild symptoms, such as low urinary protein excretion and sediment changes, to fatal AKI [ 4 , 27 , 28 ]. Severe cases of AKI are generally oliguric and hyperkalemic with a prolonged course and high mortality rate. Nonoliguric and normo- or hypokalemic AKI-forms are associated with a better prognosis [ 4 ,  27 - 29 ]. The renal pathophysiology that is consequent to leptospirosis infection is not clearly known despite advances in the knowledge of AKI epidemiology [ 4 , 5 ,  28 - 32 ]. Different factors may be involved, such as inflammatory processes, rhabdomyolysis, hemodynamic alterations, immune responses, and direct effects of leptospires and their products [ 30 ,  33 ,  31 ].\nThis study evaluated the effect of the LipL32 and Lp25 proteins on renal function in normal guinea pigs. We found that only Lp25 was associated with the development of oliguric AKI and rhabdomyolysis-induced hyperkalemia (elevated CPK, uric acid and serum phosphate).\nLp25 decreased the GFR compared LipL32 and control experiments ( Fig 1 ). These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a specific protein from pathogenic  Leptospira  spp. plays an important role in the establishment of the AKI that is observed in Weil's syndrome. In contrast, LipL32 protein did not produce a decrease in the GFR, despite a report that LipL32 induced interstitial nephritis-mediated gene expression in cultured mouse proximal tubule cells [ 34 ] and acute tubular injury in proximal pronephric ducts from zebrafish larvae kidneys [ 35 ]. These experiments were performed using  in vitro  preparations and another animal species. The decrease in GFR may not be directly dependent on the tubular damage because the FE Na  was not different between the three groups. Previous clinical studies also demonstrated that rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal injuries did not modify sodium excretion [ 36 - 38 ].\nOur results from cellular localization assays agree with previous studies that demonstrated that LipL32 was a subsurface protein that was not accessible on the leptospiral surface [ 13 ]. Notably, the role of LipL32 in Leptospira biology is not defined despite its abundant expression [ 14 ] in all pathogenic serovars. Murray and colleagues (2009) demonstrated that LipL32 was not required in acute (hamster) or chronic (rat) infection models for leptospirosis [ 39 ].\nThe results in Figs  1  and  2 , such as the increase in potassium, creatine phosphokinase, uric acid and phosphate serum levels, are characteristics of the presence of rhabdomyolysis. The classification of the muscular lesions observed in histological preparations using a score ( Fig 4 ) revealed that Lp25 induced the same type of muscular lesions as LipL32, but the Lp25 lesions were much more severe.  Fig 3  shows areas of necrosis and moderate inflammatory infiltrate in the Lp25 group, and the LipL32 group exhibited small areas of necrosis and few inflammatory areas. Immunohistochemistry with anti-rabbit Lp25 and LipL32 antisera were positive for the two proteins and both proteins exhibited the same histological patterns. The deposition of the antigens was more intense in the Lp25 group. These results suggested that the LipL32 and Lp25 proteins reached the muscle tissue and induced lesions. However, lesions in the Lp25 group were more diffuse and apparently more accentuated than the LipL32 group.\nWe also demonstrated that Lp25 was a surface-exposed and conserved protein in pathogenic species of  Leptospira . Previously published immunoblot studies using sera from leptospirosis patients and infected hamsters showed that Lp25 protein was expressed during the course of leptospiral infection [ 40 , 21 ]. This protein was recently included in the  Leptospira  endostatin-like (Len) family by the automatic NCBI prokaryotic genome re-annotation pipeline [ 41 ]. The members of the Len family bind plasminogen, laminin and human complement regulator factors [ 42 - 44 ,  18 ]. However, we previously demonstrated that Lp25 did not exhibit extracellular matrix-binding properties or play a role in immune evasion via interacting with the human complement regulator C4BP [ 17 , 45 ]. Comparative proteomic analyses of leptospira outer membrane proteins also demonstrated that the Lp25 protein, encoded by the LA0009 gene in  L .  interrogans  serovar Lai, was up-regulated (1.3-fold) after an overnight upshift to 37\u00b0C [ 46 ]. These features are also compatible with one of the potential roles of the Lp25 protein, which is causing muscular damage that consequently is associated with oliguric AKI and hyperkalemia.

Leptospira strains were cultured at 29\u00b0C under aerobic conditions in liquid EMJH medium (Difco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Boston, MA, USA.) with 10% rabbit serum, enriched with L-asparagine (0.015%), sodium pyruvate (0.001% [wt/vol]), calcium chloride (0.001% [wt/vol]), magnesium chloride (0.001% [wt/vol]), peptone (0.03% [wt/vol]), and meat extract (0.02% [wt/vol]) [ 17 ].\nSelection of proteins\nLipL32 and Lp25 proteins were chosen for this study because no research has been performed to investigate their effects on renal function experimentally in animals. Lp25 was identified by bioinformatics analyses using the  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 genome sequence previously described in studies published by our group [ 17 ]. The selection was based on the prediction of protein localization in the outer membrane. We gave priority to Lp25 because its function is not known. Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein A (LigA) [ 19 ] and LpL31 [ 20 ] were used as controls in the immunoblot analysis. LigA is a known outer membrane protein, and LipL31 is an inner membrane-associated protein [ 19 ,  20 ].\nPurification of recombinant proteins\nOpen reading frames LIC10009 (encoding a protein designated Lp25, for leptospiral protein 25, based on its molecular mass) [ 21 ] and LIC11352 (LipL32) were cloned into pAE [ 17 , 22 ] and pDEST-17 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA -or- Paisley, Scotland, UK.) vectors, respectively, as previously described [ 23 ]. The coding sequence of the carboxy-terminal portion of LigA (LigAC), corresponding to nucleotides 1891-3675 (LIC10465), was cloned into a pAE vector as previously described [ 21 ]. The coding sequence of the LipL31 (LIC11456) was amplified using PCR from genomic DNA of  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 using the following primers: F: CTCGAGGGAGATAATTCCG and R: CTGCAGTTACTGCCCAGTAG. Sequences were digested using  Xho I and  Hind III restriction enzymes, and fragments were cloned into the pAE vector [ 22 ]. Competent cells of the  E . coli  BL21(DE3) strain were transformed with pAE-Lp25, pAE-LigAC, pDEST-LipL32, and pAE-LipL31 constructs and cultivated until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37\u00b0C for 3 h. The His-tagged Lp25, LipL32, LigAC, and LipL31 proteins were purified using metal affinity chromatography, as previously described [ 21 ].\nProduction of polyclonal antisera against recombinant proteins\nA New Zealand White rabbit was immunized for each protein via subcutaneous injection of 2 mg of purified recombinant protein absorbed in aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. The rabbits were immunized more two times with the same antigen preparation with fifteen day of interval. The rabbits were bled two weeks after last immunization. The IgG fraction from sera was precipitated using caprylic acid, as previously described [ 24 ].\nIsolation of leptospiral outer membrane proteins (OMPs)\nOMPs from  L .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 were extracted with Triton X-114 according to a previously described method [ 25 ]. Three distinct fractions were recovered: (P) the detergent-insoluble pellet that corresponds to inner membranes, cytoplasmic components, and non-lysed cells; (A) the aqueous phase that contains periplasmic content, and, (D) the Triton X-114 detergent phase with outer membranes. The whole cell lysate (W) and the obtained fractions were analyzed using immunoblots with LipL32, Lp25, LigA, and LipL31 antisera.\nProteinase K accessibility assay\n .  interrogans  serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130 (5\u00d710 8  cells/ml) were harvested via centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7  g  for 7 min, gently washed with PBS containing 5 mM MgCl 2 , and collected via centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7  g  for 10 min. Washed spirochetes were gently resuspended in PBS-5mM MgCl 2 , and the evaluation of surface protein localization on intact leptospires was performed by treatment of proteinase K (PK-Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as previously described [ 13 ]. Immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies against LipL32 and Lp25.\nImmunoblotting\nProteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with LipL32, Lp25, LigA, or LipL31 rabbit polyclonal antisera (diluted 1:500). The membrane was incubated with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at a 1:5,000 dilution. The positive signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Boston, MA, USA).\nRenal function\nThe guinea pigs were housed one per metabolic cages with food and drinking water freely available. The animals were acclimated to the housing conditions for 1 day prior to experimental procedures. Three groups of animals were studied: (1) control, n = 10 (1 ml of PBS); (2) LipL32, n = 13 (1 ml of PBS plus 400 \u03bcg of LipL32) and (3) Lp25, n = 14 (1 ml of PBS plus 400 \u03bcg of Lp25). The amount of protein used per dose (400 \u03bcg) was the greatest amount maintained in solution without precipitation. The solutions were injected intraperitoneally for 4 days. The animals were placed in metabolic cages for 12 h for urine collection on day 5. The volume of each 12-h urine sample was measured gravimetrically (UV ml/12 h). Urine samples were centrifuged in aliquots to remove suspended material, and urinary creatinine and sodium in the supernatants were measured. After urine collection all animals were anesthetized with a dose of sodium pentobarbital, and whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The animals were then killed with an overdose of anesthesia. Serum potassium and sodium were measured using flame photometry. The enzymatic colorimetric method (Labtest, Lagoa Santa, Brazil) was used to measure urinary and serum levels of creatinine, CPK and uric acid. The molybdate method was used to measure serum phosphate. The creatinine clearance (CrCl) was used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by formula: CrCl = U cr  (mg/dL) x UV (ml/min) / P cr  (mg/dL), corrected by 100 g of body weight (ml/min/100 g body weight) [ 26 ]. Fractional excretion of sodium was calculated using the formula: FE Na  = U Na  x P Cr  / P Na  x U Cr  x 100%. AKI was defined as a decrease in the GFR of more than 50% from the mean value obtained in the control group (PBS), and oliguria was defined as a urinary output of less than 50% of mean value of control group (PBS). Rhabdomyolysis was defined as an elevation in serum CPK of at least 3 times the mean value obtained in the control group. The occurrence of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia was defined as an increase of phosphate, potassium, and acid uric levels of more than the mean value of control group (PBS).\nImmunohistochemistry and histology analyses\nMuscle fragments from legs and paravertebral regions were collected at the time of euthanasia, routinely fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH 7.2), embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3 \u03bcm. Fragments from kidney were also collected and submitted to routine histological procedures. Sections were analyzed using EnVision (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)-based immunohistochemistry methods, as previously described (5). The antigen retrieval step was performed by pressure cooking in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 6. Following the overnight incubation with primary rabbit polyclonal antisera (diluted 1:3,000-1:4,000) at 4\u00b0C and with secondary antibody (Envision peroxidase Dako K4002) for 30 min at room temperature. The presence of nonspecific staining was assessed using preimmune sera. Tissue sections for morphological analyses were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Gomori trichrome stain in selected sections. Muscular lesions were graded on a scale from 0 to 2: 0 as normal (without lesions), 1 as mild (chiefly the presence of individual hyaline contraction change and focal inflammatory interstitial reactivity), and 2 as severe (presence of necrosis, multiple lesions of individual myocytes and interstitial inflammatory infiltrated). Kidney sections were also fixed in 10% buffered formalin and stained with H&E for morphological analyses. Images were captured on an Axiophot Zeiss Axio microscope and analyzed using AxionVision 4.6 software.\nEthics statement\nThe Ethic Committee on Animal Use of the Butantan Institute (CEUAIB), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, previously approved the experimental protocols under the license numbers 55708 for the rabbit procedure and 99112 for guinea pig procedure.

The amount of protein used per dose (400 \u03bcg) was the greatest amount maintained in solution without precipitation. The solutions were injected intraperitoneally for 4 days. The animals were placed in metabolic cages for 12 h for urine collection on day 5. The volume of each 12-h urine sample was measured gravimetrically (UV ml/12 h). Urine samples were centrifuged in aliquots to remove suspended material, and urinary creatinine and sodium in the supernatants were measured. After urine collection all animals were anesthetized with a dose of sodium pentobarbital, and whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture. The animals were then killed with an overdose of anesthesia. Serum potassium and sodium were measured using flame photometry. The enzymatic colorimetric method (Labtest, Lagoa Santa, Brazil) was used to measure urinary and serum levels of creatinine, CPK and uric acid. The molybdate method was used to measure serum phosphate. The creatinine clearance (CrCl) was used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by formula: CrCl = U cr  (mg/dL) x UV (ml/min) / P cr  (mg/dL), corrected by 100 g of body weight (ml/min/100 g body weight) [ 26 ]. Fractional excretion of sodium was calculated using the formula: FE Na  = U Na  x P Cr  / P Na  x U Cr  x 100%. AKI was defined as a decrease in the GFR of more than 50% from the mean value obtained in the control group (PBS), and oliguria was defined as a urinary output of less than 50% of mean value of control group (PBS). Rhabdomyolysis was defined as an elevation in serum CPK of at least 3 times the mean value obtained in the control group. The occurrence of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia was defined as an increase of phosphate, potassium, and acid uric levels of more than the mean value of control group (PBS).\n", "Immunohistochemistry and histology analyses\nMuscle fragments from legs and paravertebral regions were collected at the time of euthanasia, routinely fixed in 10% buffered formalin (pH 7.2), embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3 \u03bcm. Fragments from kidney were also collected and submitted to routine histological procedures. Sections were analyzed using EnVision (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)-based immunohistochemistry methods, as previously described (5). The antigen retrieval step was performed by pressure cooking in 10 mM sodium citrate pH 6. Following the overnight incubation with primary rabbit polyclonal antisera (diluted 1:3,000-1:4,000) at 4\u00b0C and with secondary antibody (Envision peroxidase Dako K4002) for 30 min at room temperature. The presence of nonspecific staining was assessed using preimmune sera. Tissue sections for morphological analyses were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Gomori trichrome stain in selected sections. Muscular lesions were graded on a scale from 0 to 2: 0 as normal (without lesions), 1 as mild (chiefly the presence of individual hyaline contraction change and focal inflammatory interstitial reactivity), and 2 as severe (presence of necrosis, multiple lesions of individual myocytes and interstitial inflammatory infiltrated). Kidney sections were also fixed in 10% buffered formalin and stained with H&E for morphological analyses.

{"doc_key": "8247374_Discussion", "text": ["\nSince its introduction in 1957, 5FU has been a first-choice drug for CRC chemotherapy. However, resistance to 5FU develops as treatment time increases, disrupting its successful anti-tumor effect. It is generally believed that 5FU resistance is associated with enhanced DNA repair and accelerated drug metabolism. The catabolism of 5FU relies on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism and histone-related transcription can increase DPD expression in CRC cells, leading to 5FU resistance  28 . Clinically, 5FU is often used in combination with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and other drugs to increase its therapeutic effect  29 , but the development of drug resistance cannot be avoided. Studies have shown that DNA polymerase zeta REV7 upregulation contributes to 5FU and oxaliplatin resistance when used in combination  30 . Therefore, other types of solutions are needed to avoid the development of 5FU resistance in CRC.\nThe Warburg effect, which is based on abnormal glucose metabolism, promotes drug resistance in CRC. Chemotherapy in CRC also reprograms the metabolic pathways of surviving tumor cells. These surviving cells, namely drug-resistant cells, undergo a series of changes that enhance their malignant phenotypes, including a tumor stem cell-like phenotype, which leads to tumor metastasis and tumor immunosuppression  31 ,  32 . PDK2 was highly expressed in 5FU resistant cells, while dichloroacetate or miRNA targeting PDK2 enhanced CRC cell sensitivity to 5FU  33 . LncRNA XIST promoted glycolysis and 5FU chemoresistance in CRC by increasing PKM2 levels  34 . These metabolic enzymes act as direct regulators of glucose metabolism and are responsible for CRC chemoresistance. Our study revealed that IDH1, a key enzyme involved in glucose metabolism, enhanced CRC cell growth and 5FU resistance. Therefore, IDH1-related tumor metabolism may be a target for the treatment of 5FU-resistant CRC.\nPrevious studies have confirmed that IDH1 mediates chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer  35 ,  36 , while there is a lack of research on chemoresistance in colorectal cancer. Most studies have focused on the activation of IDH1 R132 mutations, which are often found in many types of tumors. IDH1 R132 promotes tumor progression and treatment tolerance, which can be mainly attributed to its abnormal metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. Anti-apoptotic genes can be targeted to inhibit tumors carrying IDH1 mutations  37 . A previous study  38  and our data showed that unmutated IDH1 was highly expressed in tumor tissues and was accompanied by an increase in the production of \u03b1-KG and NADPH. This indicates that the upregulation of IDH1 can reprogram the metabolic state of tumor cells, enhancing tumor growth and chemoresistance. Despite being a subtype of isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH1 is not involved in the oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in mitochondria. IDH1 is mainly located in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes and maintains the reducing internal environment by producing reducing substances, such as NADPH  39 . We speculated that IDH1 was delivered to sensitive CRC cells via exosomes, which in turn increased the viability of cells under 5FU treatment through the accumulation of NADPH. This novel form of tumor metabolic reprogramming will have an effect on tumor phenotype.\nWe found that exosomes transmitted the IDH1 protein to sensitive cells and promoted CRC cell resistance to 5FU. A previous study revealed that the 5FU-resistant CRC cell line RKO/R secretes exosomes that enhance 5FU resistance in RKO cells. This process relies on the phosphorylated STAT3 protein in exosomes  40 . Therefore, exosomal proteins are critical disseminators of 5FU resistance in CRC cells. Apart from the exosomes secreted by drug-resistant cells, other components in the tumor microenvironment also produce other 5FU resistance-inducing exosomal proteins that are delivered to CRC cells. In the tumor microenvironment, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secrete exosomes that carry Wnt, which promote CRC cell differentiation into tumor stem cells  41 . These exosomal proteins are regarded as effective targets to reverse CRC resistance, and further research is needed to explore the mechanisms involved. Apart from the exosomal proteins derived from resistant cells that were identified through our exosomal proteomics results, other exosomal proteins that cause 5FU resistance in CRC cells also need to be identified. Additionally, CAFs also transmit miRNA-encapsulated exosomes to CRC cells to enhance tumor cell invasiveness and 5FU resistance  42 . Multiple exosomal miRNAs, including miRNA-125b, miR-21, and miR-210, are involved in CRC cell resistance to 5FU and serve as biomarkers of the malignant phenotype and the therapeutic effect of CRC  43 - 45 . Therefore, the complete elucidation of exosomal proteins or RNAs that cause 5FU resistance will allow for the advancement of tumor treatment methods.\nIn summary, our data proves that enhanced expression of IDH1 in CRC tissues can mediate the rapid growth of CRC cells and the occurrence of chemoresistance. Exosomes secreted by 5FU-resistant CRC cells contribute to the growth of sensitive CRC cells and the development of 5FU resistance. This resistance depends on the communication between resistant and sensitive cells, which is mediated by exosomal IDH1. Exosomal IDH1 can increase the concentration of metabolites of \u03b1-KG and NADPH in sensitive cells, ensuring CRC cell survival in a 5FU environment. IDH1 and exosomal IDH1 are potential targets for CRC treatment and drug resistance.\n"], "ner": [[[70, 73, "DISEASE"], [347, 378, "GENE"], [380, 383, "GENE"], [471, 474, "GENE"], [489, 492, "DISEASE"], [954, 957, "DISEASE"]], [[1054, 1057, "DISEASE"], [1075, 1078, "DISEASE"], [1381, 1385, "GENE"], [1472, 1476, "GENE"], [1486, 1489, "DISEASE"], [1579, 1582, "DISEASE"], [1597, 1601, "GENE"], [1710, 1713, "DISEASE"], [1755, 1759, "GENE"], [1815, 1818, "DISEASE"], [1862, 1866, "GENE"], [1943, 1946, "DISEASE"]], [[1985, 1989, "GENE"], [1999, 2014, "RELATION"], [2018, 2032, "DISEASE"], [2037, 2055, "DISEASE"], [2124, 2141, "DISEASE"], [2190, 2194, "GENE"], [2258, 2262, "GENE"], [2462, 2466, "GENE"], [2540, 2544, "GENE"], [2695, 2699, "GENE"], [2847, 2851, "GENE"], [2937, 2941, "GENE"], [3114, 3118, "GENE"], [3146, 3149, "DISEASE"]], [[3400, 3404, "GENE"], [3445, 3448, "DISEASE"], [3522, 3525, "DISEASE"], [3644, 3649, "GENE"], [3753, 3756, "DISEASE"], [3952, 3955, "DISEASE"], [3994, 4000, "DISEASE"], [4078, 4081, "DISEASE"], [4200, 4203, "DISEASE"], [4460, 4463, "DISEASE"], [4562, 4565, "DISEASE"], [4717, 4720, "DISEASE"], [4825, 4828, "DISEASE"]], [[5023, 5042, "RELATION"], [5046, 5050, "GENE"], [5054, 5057, "DISEASE"], [5098, 5101, "DISEASE"], [5393, 5397, "GENE"], [5408, 5412, "GENE"], [5506, 5509, "DISEASE"], [5546, 5550, "GENE"], [5564, 5568, "GENE"], [[5583, 5599], [5594, 5608], "RELATION"], [5595, 5598, "DISEASE"], [5613, 5628, "RELATION"]]], "relations": [[], [], [[1985, 1989, 2018, 2032, "therapy resistance"], [1985, 1989, 2037, 2055, "therapy resistance"]], [], [[5046, 5050, 5054, 5057, "increased expression"], [5546, 5550, 5595, 5598, "therapeutic target"], [5546, 5550, 5595, 5598, "therapy resistance"], [5564, 5568, 5595, 5598, "therapeutic target"], [5564, 5568, 5595, 5598, "therapy resistance"]]], "triplets": [[], [], [[1985, 1989, 2018, 2032, 1999, 2014], [1985, 1989, 2037, 2055, 1999, 2014]], [], [[5046, 5050, 5054, 5057, 5023, 5042], [5546, 5550, 5595, 5598, [5583, 5599], [5594, 5608]], [5564, 5568, 5595, 5598, [5583, 5599], [5594, 5608]], [5546, 5550, 5595, 5598, 5613, 5628], [5564, 5568, 5595, 5598, 5613, 5628]]], "triplets_text": [[], [], [["IDH1", "ovarian cancer", "chemoresistance"], ["IDH1", "endometrial cancer", "chemoresistance"]], [], [["IDH1", "CRC", "enhanced expression"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "targets for treatment"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "targets for treatment"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "drug resistance"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "drug resistance"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], "sentences": ["\nSince its introduction in 1957, 5FU has been a first-choice drug for CRC chemotherapy.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) catalyzes the production of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) from the substrate isocitrate, which is accompanied by a reduction in NADPH  10 ,  11 . IDH1 expression is elevated in various tumor types, including osteosarcoma, lung cancer, or gastric cancer, compared with normal tissues  12 - 14 . The function activating mutation of IDH1 is also associated with the development of glioma and the tolerance of targeted therapy  15 . As a metabolite of IDH1, \u03b1-KG is essential for maintaining dioxygenase activity in the cytoplasm  16 . NADPH participates in defense against adverse oxidative reactions in cells, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by chemotherapy drugs  17 . Therefore, IDH1 and its associated metabolites are beneficial for the maintainence of tumor survival and the harsh external environment. At present, the commercial IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (also known as AG-120) has been applied to clinical trials to treat cholangiocarcinoma and leukemia  18 ,  19 . The role of IDH1 in the development of resistance to 5FU or other chemotherapeutic drugs in CRC has not been revealed yet.\nExosomes are nanoscale extracellular vesicles secreted by various types of cells that are widely involved in intercellular communication. They deliver their contents (including DNA, RNA, and proteins) providing instructions from the source cell to the recipient cell  20 . Among tumor cells, exosomes are involved in tumorigenesis, invasion, immune response, and chemotherapy resistance and can regulate the tumor microenvironment  21 . For example, exosomal miR-105 secreted by breast cancer cells can reprogram glucose metabolism in cancer-associated fibroblasts to support tumor growth  22 . In CRC cells, exosomal miR-128-3p enhanced chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin  23 . Our previous study found that exosomes derived from cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells delivered PKM2 to reprogram glucose metabolism in sensitive cells and transmit drug resistance to sensitive cells  24 . In CRC cells, the involvement of exosomes in cell metabolism and drug resistance development is not yet fully understood.\nIn this study, we found that IDH1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues and was the driver of 5FU resistance in CRC cells. Proteomics and cytology analyses were conducted to verify that 5FU-resistant CRC cells secreted exosomes that encapsulated high levels of IDH1. These exosomes derived from drug-resistant cells increased the resistance of sensitive cells to 5FU by reprogramming the reducing internal environment of sensitive cells. Our results elucidated the role of exosomal IDH1 in 5FU resistance in CRC.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 18, "DISEASE"], [20, 23, "DISEASE"], [58, 64, "DISEASE"], [124, 127, "DISEASE"], [293, 296, "DISEASE"], [363, 366, "DISEASE"], [615, 618, "DISEASE"]], [[790, 794, "GENE"], [796, 800, "GENE"], [806, 810, "GENE"], [833, 836, "DISEASE"], [837, 848, "RELATION"], [870, 893, "RELATION"], [903, 929, "GENE"], [931, 935, "GENE"], [1076, 1080, "GENE"], [1081, 1103, "RELATION"], [1138, 1150, "DISEASE"], [1152, 1163, "DISEASE"], [1168, 1182, "DISEASE"], [1228, 1256, "RELATION"], [1260, 1264, "GENE"], [1293, 1304, "RELATION"], [1308, 1314, "DISEASE"], [1378, 1382, "GENE"], [1623, 1627, "GENE"], [1776, 1780, "GENE"], [1870, 1888, "DISEASE"], [1893, 1901, "DISEASE"], [1926, 1930, "GENE"], [2006, 2009, "DISEASE"]], [[2516, 2529, "DISEASE"], [2572, 2578, "DISEASE"], [2635, 2638, "DISEASE"], [2785, 2796, "DISEASE"], [2813, 2817, "GENE"], [2926, 2929, "DISEASE"]], [[3074, 3078, "GENE"], [3083, 3099, "RELATION"], [3103, 3106, "DISEASE"], [3155, 3158, "DISEASE"], [3243, 3246, "DISEASE"], [3304, 3308, "GENE"], [3525, 3529, "GENE"], [3551, 3554, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], [[790, 794, 833, 836, "pathological role"], [790, 794, 833, 836, "therapy resistance"], [796, 800, 833, 836, "pathological role"], [796, 800, 833, 836, "therapy resistance"], [806, 810, 833, 836, "pathological role"], [806, 810, 833, 836, "therapy resistance"], [1076, 1080, 1138, 1150, "increased expression"], [1076, 1080, 1152, 1163, "increased expression"], [1076, 1080, 1168, 1182, "increased expression"], [1260, 1264, 1308, 1314, "causative activation"], [1260, 1264, 1308, 1314, "pathological role"]], [], [[3074, 3078, 3103, 3106, "increased expression"]]], "triplets": [[], [[790, 794, 833, 836, 837, 848], [796, 800, 833, 836, 837, 848], [806, 810, 833, 836, 837, 848], [790, 794, 833, 836, 870, 893], [796, 800, 833, 836, 870, 893], [806, 810, 833, 836, 870, 893], [1076, 1080, 1138, 1150, 1081, 1103], [1076, 1080, 1152, 1163, 1081, 1103], [1076, 1080, 1168, 1182, 1081, 1103], [1260, 1264, 1308, 1314, 1228, 1256], [1260, 1264, 1308, 1314, 1293, 1304]], [], [[3074, 3078, 3103, 3106, 3083, 3099]]], "triplets_text": [[], [["PKM2", "CRC", "development"], ["PDK1", "CRC", "development"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "development"], ["PKM2", "CRC", "chemotherapy resistance"], ["PDK1", "CRC", "chemotherapy resistance"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "chemotherapy resistance"], ["IDH1", "osteosarcoma", "expression is elevated"], ["IDH1", "lung cancer", "expression is elevated"], ["IDH1", "gastric cancer", "expression is elevated"], ["IDH1", "glioma", "function activating mutation"], ["IDH1", "glioma", "development"]], [], [["IDH1", "CRC", "highly expressed"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3], "sentences": ["\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most deadly type of cancer in the United States  1 .

{"doc_key": "8247374_Results", "text": ["\nHigh expression of IDH1 can predict the malignant progression of colorectal cancer\nWe first evaluated the expression pattern of IDH1 in human clinical samples. The expression of IDH1 in the tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues of the 125 CRC patients was determined using immunohistochemistry (Figure  1 A). Quantitative statistical analysis of the expression of IDH1 showed that IDH1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues (Figure  1 B). Further analysis showed that a high-stage CRC tumor was significantly associated with a high IDH1 expression score (p = 0.0152, Figure  1 C). The clinical data of the 87 CRC patients with high IDH1 expression tumors and 38 patients with low IDH1 expression tumors showed that high IDH1 expression was associated with a high-stage tumor (p < 0.001), distant metastasis (p = 0.006) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002, Table  1 ). Therefore, the high expression of IDH1 in CRC may be an indicator of malignant features.\nIDH1 promotes the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and resistance to 5FU\nNext, we explored the effect of IDH1 on tumor growth in CRC cell lines. The CRC cell line, HCT8, stably expressed Flag-IDH1. Cell proliferation assays showed that IDH1 overexpression enhanced the proliferation of HCT8 cells  in vitro  (Figure  2 A and B). Meanwhile, we established two HCT8 cell lines (shIDH1-994 and shIDH1-1404) with stable IDH1 knockdown using shRNA lentiviral plasmids. The results showed that the proliferation of HCT8 cells with IDH1 knockdown using shRNA was significantly slower than that of the control group (Figure  2 C and D). Cell cycle assays using flow cytometry showed that the overexpression of Flag-IDH1 decreased the proportion of HCT8 cells at the G1 phase and increased the proportion at the G2 phase (Figure  2 E and F). Compared with control cells, the cell lines expressing IDH1-shRNA showed a significant increase in the proportion of cells at the G1 phase and a decrease in the proportion of cells at the S phase (Figure  2 G and H), indicating that IDH1 knockdown inhibited G1-S transition in the CRC cell cycle.\nThe role of IDH1 in the development of CRC chemoresistance was explored. Compared with the control vector, Flag-IDH1 increased the survival rate of HCT8 cells under different concentrations (0.5, 2 \u00b5g/ml) of 5FU treatment (Figure  2 I), indicating that IDH1 overexpression promoted the development of 5FU resistance. The results of the cell invasion assays showed that the invasive ability of HCT8 cells decreased after IDH1 knockdown, and that IDH1-shRNA combined with 5FU treatment further inhibited cell invasion (Figure  2 J and K). These results confirm that IDH1 promotes the proliferation of CRC cells and resistance to 5FU. The combination of IDH1-knockdown and 5FU therapy can enhance the inhibition effect on the malignant behavior of CRC cells.\nExosomes secreted by 5FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells induce drug resistance\nTo study the mechanism by which 5FU resistance develops and is transmitted in colorectal cancer, we established a 5FU-resistant HCT8 cell line, HCT8FU. Cell viability assays were used to evaluate the resistance of HCT8FU cells to 5FU and to show that these cells were more resistant to 5FU than the drug-sensitive HCT8 cell line (Figure  3 A). We attempted to determine whether exosomes are involved in the communication between different subgroups of colorectal cancer cells and the transmission of 5FU resistance. Exosomes (HCT8-exo and HCT8FU-exo) were isolated from HCT8 and HCT8FU cells through ultracentrifugation, and their morphology was observed using a transmission electron microscope (Figure  3 B). Western blotting assays revealed that the exosomal markers, CD63 and TSG101, were expressed by HCT8-exo and HCT8FU-exo (Figure  3 D), indicating successful isolation of the exosomes. Nanoparticle size analysis studies showed that these exosomes were of an average diameter of 100-250 nm (Figure  3 C). Next, 40 \u03bcg/ml HCT8-exo or HCT8FU-exo was co-cultured with sensitive HCT8 cells for 24 to 96 h. The results showed that HCT8FU-exo significantly increased HCT8 cell proliferation (Figure  3 E). The 5FU-sensitive HCT8 cells were incubated with 40 \u03bcg/ml HCT8-exo or HCT8FU-exo for 48 h and then exposed to 5FU for 48 h. The 5FU resistance of HCT8 cells was enhanced by HCT8FU-exo, compared with HCT8-exo (Figure  3 F). These results suggest that exosomes secreted by 5FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells promoted drug resistance in sensitive colorectal cancer cells.\nHigh expression of IDH1 in exosomes secreted by 5FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells\nLC-MS/MS was used to obtain the protein expression profile of the exosomes derived from sensitive HCT8 cells (HCT8-exo) and exosomes derived from resistant HCT8FU cells (HCT8FU-exo) to determine differences in exosomal proteins derived from 5FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells and sensitive cells. The iBAQ algorithm was used for the absolute quantification of proteins, and 1,629 differentially expressed proteins were found between HCT8-exo and HCT8FU-exo. Of these, 95 proteins were highly expressed by HCT8-exo, while 1,534 proteins were highly expressed by HCT8FU-exo. Further, KEGG enrichment analysis of the highly expressed proteins in HCT8FU-exo showed that these proteins enriched in 5FU-resistant exosomes were involved in regulation of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and environmental information pathways (Figure  4 A and  4 B). The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that in HCT8-exo, immune system regulatory proteins and metabolic pathway-related proteins were highly enriched in exosomes derived from sensitive cells (Figure  4 C and  4 D). The proteins highly expressed by HCT8FU-exo included proteins that regulate glucose metabolism, including IDH1 (Figure  4 E), while proteins involved in cell metabolism were highly expressed by HCT8-exo (Figure  4 F). The absolute protein quantification of iBAQ using LC-MS/MS results showed that IDH1 was highly expressed in the exosomes of 5FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells (Figure  4 G). Western blotting assays also demonstrated a high level of IDHI expression in HCT8FU-exo (Figure  4 H). These results indicate that exosomal IDH1 may be involved in the development and transmission of 5FU resistance in colorectal cancer cells.\nExosomal IDH1 promotes 5FU resistance in colorectal cancer cells\nThe viability of the HCT8 cells under 5FU exposure was used to determine whether the exosomal IDH1 derived from resistant cells could induce 5FU resistance in sensitive cells. Exosomes derived from HCT8 cells that expressed Flag-IDH1 were isolated, and exosomal IDH1 was overexpressed (Figure  5 A). Exosomes with high IDH1 expression (HCT8-exo IDH1 ) and control exosomes (HCT8-exo vector ) were co-cultured with HCT8 cells and then exposed to 5FU. The results showed that exosomes with elevated IDH1 expression significantly promoted 5FU resistance in HCT8 cells (Figure  5 B). Exosomes derived from HCT8FU cells (HCT8FU-exo shIDH1-994  and HCT8FU-exo shIDH1-1404 ) with stable IDH1 knockdown were also extracted (Figure  5 C) and co-cultured with HCT8 cells. Exosomes with low levels of IDH1 expression enhanced the sensitivity of HCT8 cells to 5FU (Figure  5 D). The commercial IDH1 inhibitor, ivosidenib, was used to treat HCT8FU cells, and then exosomes were extracted (HCT8FU-exo ivosidenib ) and used to increase the drug sensitivity of HCT8 cells (Figure  5 E). Together, these results indicate that drug-resistant colorectal cancer cells secrete exosomes that confer 5FU resistance to sensitive cells by delivering IDH1.\nExosomal IDH1-mediated glycometabolism reprogramming is involved in 5FU resistance\nThe exosomes derived from drug-resistant cells that delivered IDH1 accelerated the glucose metabolism of the sensitive cells that took them up to achieve 5FU resistance. HCT8 cells that ingested HCT8FU-exo showed significantly increased glucose consumption than those that ingested HCT8-exo (Figure  6 A). HCT8FU-exo also increased levels of intracellular \u03b1-KG production in HCT8 cells, compared with HCT8-exo (Figure  6 B). Monitoring of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity showed that IDH1 activity was elevated in HCT8 cells that ingested HCT8FU-exo (Figure  6 C). IDH1 mediates the production of the intracellular reducing metabolite, NADPH, while previous studies have also indicated that NADPH can neutralize tumor cell damage caused by chemotherapy drugs  17 ,  27 . In 5FU-resistant HCT8FU cells, the basal level of NADPH was higher than that of sensitive HCT8 cells (Figure  6 D). 5FU significantly decreased the level of NADPH in HCT8 cells, which gave evidence that the cytotoxicity of 5FU was accompanied by low levels of NADPH (Figure  6 D). When HCT8FU-exo was co-cultured with HCT8 cells treated with 5FU, intracellular NADPH levels did not show a significant change (Figure  6 E). To reverse the effect of exosomal IDH1 on the production of NADPH, we used 5FU to treat HCT8 cells that had internalized HCT8FU-exo shIDH1-994 , HCT8FU-exo shIDH1-1404  (Figure  6 F) or HCT8FU-exo ivosidenib  (Figure  6 G). The results showed that 5FU decreased NADPH levels in HCT8 cells co-cultured with HCT8FU-exo, whose IDH1 activity or content was inhibited (Figure  6 F and  6 G). To revert resistance caused by exosomal IDH1, the IDH1 inhibitor, ivosidenib, and 5FU co-treatment were used. Compared with 5FU, the combination of ivosidenib and 5FU significantly decreased NADPH levels in HCT8FU cells (Figure  6 H). Our data confirmed that drug-resistant cells secrete IDH1-containing exosomes that increase the intracellular NADPH levels of sensitive cells that trigger drug resistance.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 16, "RELATION"], [20, 24, "GENE"], [29, 62, "RELATION"], [66, 83, "DISEASE"], [129, 133, "GENE"], [179, 183, "GENE"], [251, 254, "DISEASE"], [376, 380, "GENE"], [393, 397, "GENE"], [402, 418, "RELATION"], [422, 425, "DISEASE"], [491, 494, "DISEASE"], [[537, 547], [541, 563], "RELATION"], [542, 546, "GENE"], [619, 622, "DISEASE"], [[637, 647], [641, 657], "RELATION"], [642, 646, "GENE"], [690, 694, "GENE"], [730, 734, "GENE"], [894, 909, "RELATION"], [913, 917, "GENE"], [921, 924, "DISEASE"], [935, 966, "RELATION"]], [[968, 972, "GENE"], [1003, 1020, "DISEASE"], [1081, 1085, "GENE"], [1105, 1108, "DISEASE"], [1125, 1128, "DISEASE"], [1168, 1172, "GENE"], [1212, 1216, "GENE"], [1392, 1396, "GENE"], [1501, 1505, "GENE"], [1683, 1687, "GENE"], [1864, 1868, "GENE"], [2042, 2046, "GENE"], [2090, 2093, "DISEASE"]], [[2118, 2122, "GENE"], [2145, 2148, "DISEASE"], [2218, 2222, "GENE"], [2359, 2363, "GENE"], [2526, 2530, "GENE"], [2551, 2555, "GENE"], [2670, 2674, "GENE"], [2705, 2708, "DISEASE"], [2757, 2761, "GENE"], [2851, 2854, "DISEASE"]], [[2897, 2914, "DISEASE"], [3022, 3039, "DISEASE"], [3396, 3413, "DISEASE"], [3715, 3719, "GENE"], [3724, 3730, "GENE"], [4436, 4453, "DISEASE"], [4498, 4515, "DISEASE"]], [[4523, 4538, "RELATION"], [4542, 4546, "GENE"], [4585, 4602, "DISEASE"], [4864, 4881, "DISEASE"], [5782, 5786, "GENE"], [5973, 5977, "GENE"], [5982, 5998, "RELATION"], [6032, 6049, "DISEASE"], [6211, 6215, "GENE"], [6289, 6306, "DISEASE"]], [[6323, 6327, "GENE"], [6355, 6372, "DISEASE"], [6473, 6477, "GENE"], [6608, 6612, "GENE"], [6641, 6645, "GENE"], [6698, 6702, "GENE"], [6876, 6880, "GENE"], [7059, 7063, "GENE"], [7169, 7173, "GENE"], [7261, 7265, "GENE"], [7503, 7520, "DISEASE"], [7604, 7608, "GENE"]], [[7619, 7623, "GENE"], [7755, 7759, "GENE"], [8178, 8182, "GENE"], [8259, 8263, "GENE"], [8922, 8926, "GENE"], [9212, 9216, "GENE"], [9325, 9329, "GENE"], [9563, 9567, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[20, 24, 66, 83, "increased expression"], [20, 24, 66, 83, "negative prognostic marker"], [393, 397, 422, 425, "increased expression"], [542, 546, 491, 494, "increased expression"], [642, 646, 619, 622, "increased expression"], [913, 917, 921, 924, "increased expression"], [913, 917, 921, 924, "negative prognostic marker"]], [], [], [], [[4542, 4546, 4585, 4602, "increased expression"], [5973, 5977, 6032, 6049, "increased expression"]], [], []], "triplets": [[[20, 24, 66, 83, 1, 16], [20, 24, 66, 83, 29, 62], [393, 397, 422, 425, 402, 418], [542, 546, 491, 494, [537, 547], [541, 563]], [642, 646, 619, 622, [637, 647], [641, 657]], [913, 917, 921, 924, 894, 909], [913, 917, 921, 924, 935, 966]], [], [], [], [[4542, 4546, 4585, 4602, 4523, 4538], [5973, 5977, 6032, 6049, 5982, 5998]], [], []], "triplets_text": [[["IDH1", "colorectal cancer", "High expression"], ["IDH1", "colorectal cancer", "predict the malignant progression"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "highly expressed"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "high expression score"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "high expression"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "high expression"], ["IDH1", "CRC", "indicator of malignant features"]], [], [], [], [["IDH1", "colorectal cancer", "High expression"], ["IDH1", "colorectal cancer", "highly expressed"]], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "sentences": ["\nHigh expression of IDH1 can predict the malignant progression of colorectal cancer\nWe first evaluated the expression pattern of IDH1 in human clinical samples. The expression of IDH1 in the tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues of the 125 CRC patients was determined using immunohistochemistry (Figure  1 A). Quantitative statistical analysis of the expression of IDH1 showed that IDH1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues (Figure  1 B). Further analysis showed that a high-stage CRC tumor was significantly associated with a high IDH1 expression score (p = 0.0152, Figure  1 C). The clinical data of the 87 CRC patients with high IDH1 expression tumors and 38 patients with low IDH1 expression tumors showed that high IDH1 expression was associated with a high-stage tumor (p < 0.001), distant metastasis (p = 0.006) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002, Table  1 ). Therefore, the high expression of IDH1 in CRC may be an indicator of malignant features.\n", "IDH1 promotes the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and resistance to 5FU\nNext, we explored the effect of IDH1 on tumor growth in CRC cell lines. The CRC cell line, HCT8, stably expressed Flag-IDH1. Cell proliferation assays showed that IDH1 overexpression enhanced the proliferation of HCT8 cells  in vitro  (Figure  2 A and B). Meanwhile, we established two HCT8 cell lines (shIDH1-994 and shIDH1-1404) with stable IDH1 knockdown using shRNA lentiviral plasmids. The results showed that the proliferation of HCT8 cells with IDH1 knockdown using shRNA was significantly slower than that of the control group (Figure  2 C and D). Cell cycle assays using flow cytometry showed that the overexpression of Flag-IDH1 decreased the proportion of HCT8 cells at the G1 phase and increased the proportion at the G2 phase (Figure  2 E and F). Compared with control cells, the cell lines expressing IDH1-shRNA showed a significant increase in the proportion of cells at the G1 phase and a decrease in the proportion of cells at the S phase (Figure  2 G and H), indicating that IDH1 knockdown inhibited G1-S transition in the CRC cell cycle.\n", "The role of IDH1 in the development of CRC chemoresistance was explored. Compared with the control vector, Flag-IDH1 increased the survival rate of HCT8 cells under different concentrations (0.5, 2 \u00b5g/ml) of 5FU treatment (Figure  2 I), indicating that IDH1 overexpression promoted the development of 5FU resistance. The results of the cell invasion assays showed that the invasive ability of HCT8 cells decreased after IDH1 knockdown, and that IDH1-shRNA combined with 5FU treatment further inhibited cell invasion (Figure  2 J and K). These results confirm that IDH1 promotes the proliferation of CRC cells and resistance to 5FU. The combination of IDH1-knockdown and 5FU therapy can enhance the inhibition effect on the malignant behavior of CRC cells.\n", "Exosomes secreted by 5FU-resistant colorectal cancer cells induce drug resistance\nTo study the mechanism by which 5FU resistance develops and is transmitted in colorectal cancer, we established a 5FU-resistant HCT8 cell line, HCT8FU. Cell viability assays were used to evaluate the resistance of HCT8FU cells to 5FU and to show that these cells were more resistant to 5FU than the drug-sensitive HCT8 cell line (Figure  3 A). We attempted to determine whether exosomes are involved in the communication between different subgroups of colorectal cancer cells and the transmission of 5FU resistance. Exosomes (HCT8-exo and HCT8FU-exo) were isolated from HCT8 and HCT8FU cells through ultracentrifugation, and their morphology was observed using a transmission electron microscope (Figure  3 B). Western blotting assays revealed that the exosomal markers, CD63 and TSG101, were expressed by HCT8-exo and HCT8FU-exo (Figure  3 D), indicating successful isolation of the exosomes. Nanoparticle size analysis studies showed that these exosomes were of an average diameter of 100-250 nm (Figure  3 C). Next, 40 \u03bcg/ml HCT8-exo or HCT8FU-exo was co-cultured with sensitive HCT8 cells for 24 to 96 h. The results showed that HCT8FU-exo significantly increased HCT8 cell proliferation (Figure  3 E). The 5FU-sensitive HCT8 cells were incubated with 40 \u03bcg/ml HCT8-exo or HCT8FU-exo for 48 h and then exposed to 5FU for 48 h.

Human research studies using the LAL assay often poorly report the methodology employed; sample pre-treatment conditions are often not stated [ 36 ], referenced to manufacturer's instructions (which are non-existent for endotoxin levels observed under conditions of ME using a Lonza kit) [ 37 ], or are scant [ 18 , 30 ].\nThe key finding of this study was that existing published LAL sample inhibitor neutralization pre-treatments of 70 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C for both 15 and 30 min, vortexed for 2 min and subsequently diluted 1:50, 1:75, 1:100, and 1:200, or diluted 1:10, heat treated to 70 \u00b0C for 10 min, vortexed for one minute and ultrasonicated for 10 min or diluted using 0.5% pyrosperse and analyzed using the LAL chromogenic assay were not suitable to detect endotoxin levels in plasma, amongst overweight men typically exhibiting ME. There are two key findings which substantiate this. Firstly, ME has long been associated with obesity. In the current study, obesity (BMI) was significantly related to the indirect measure of endotoxemia (LBP) with a moderate effect size, yet there were no relationships between BMI and the direct measure of endotoxemia (LPS) using the LAL chromogenic assay under any of the sample pre-treatment conditions examined. The positive correlation between BMI and LBP concur with many other research groups [ 9 , 35 , 38 ], including our own [ 34 ], and in varied ethnic populations [ 11 , 12 ], yet surprisingly many research groups reporting on ME measures, particularly those addressing methodology, fail to report on this relationship.\nSecondly, the literature commonly reports both the LAL chromogenic assay [ 21 , 30 , 31 ] and LBP ELISA assay for quantifying ME [ 21 , 32 ], despite the mechanisms for detection being very different [ 7 , 16 ]. As such, one would expect to observe a direct positive relationship between both measures in the fasting state. However, this was not the case in our study. Endotoxin levels determined using the LBP ELISA assay failed to correlate with any of the 17 variants of sample pre-treatment for analysis performed using the LAL assay. Interestingly, we have previously failed to find a relationship between LBP and LPS in 10 healthy overweight and obese males in the fasting state (r = -0.341,  p  = 0.369; unpublished data) and Ghamim et al. who used both LAL and LBP assays to measure ME failed to detect a fasting relationship between the two measures of endotoxemia [ 21 ].\nThere are several possible explanations for this lack of correlation; the most likely was deactivation of endogenous sample compounds capable of interfering with the clotting cascade was incomplete [ 39 , 40 ]. The most common methods reported for ameliorating this inhibition or enhancement have been the combination of dilution and heating [ 25 , 41 , 42 ], solvent extraction [ 39 ], sonication [ 25 , 43 ], and acid treatment [ 41 , 44 ], or combinations thereof. While the most commonly reported heat treatments, dilutions, and the use of sonication were employed in this study, the lack of correlation between LBP and LPS suggests that they were not sufficient to deactivate the inhibitors. Secondly, LBP is produced principally by the liver in response to LPS exposure, making LBP levels dependent on hepatic function, unlike the LAL assay which is a direct measure of LPS activity. In an acute exposure to a bolus of LPS, LBP is consumed by binding to LPS and transported to responding immune cells-producing a paradoxical fall in LBP rather than increase. However, as all of the men in this study were heathy, not experiencing any acute event likely to produce a bolus exposure to LPS, this pattern is unlikely to explain the lack of correlation between LBP and LAL quantified endotoxemia.\nFinally, ME mirrors the activity of LPS, which in the case of the LAL analysis is based on the structure of the lipid-A moiety and polysaccharide chain [ 45 ]. We acknowledge that various LPS species exist with numerous activities according to their molecular structure, so it is possible that the increased levels of endotoxin may be the result of an increased number of LPS molecules, or a similar level of LPS molecules with increased activity due to different chemical structures [ 31 ]. It has also been suggested that this discrepancy could be more fully understood by assessing the biochemical forms of LPS in parallel with the LAL assay at an optimum dilution [ 31 ]. However, while this has been successful under conditions of sepsis [ 46 ], correlations for LPS determined by the LAL analysis and biochemical methods of analysis (HPLC-MS/MS) are still lacking under conditions of ME [ 47 ].\nThe strengths of this study include the quality measures taken to ensure the accuracy of the polynomial model; all correlation coefficients were greater than 0.980, and the agreement between replicates (%CV) was less than 10%. The activation of the LAL test is also easily detected by a fast response in the positive product control (PPC) well. The manufacturer specifies the reactivity of such PPC should lie within 50-200% and we report on compliance to this range and only included samples adhering to this range in the analysis. Additionally, the percentage coefficient of variation between two replicate analyses of the same sample was less than 10% as recommended by the manufacturer. Care was also taken to minimize cross contamination through the use of endotoxin free reagents (LAL water), pipette tips, glass storage containers, etc. [ 32 ], and this was confirmed through the use of 'reagent blanks'. The type of collection tube has been shown to affect the analysis; in this study, blood was collected in heparin tubes, centrifuged within 3 h of collection and then transferred to endotoxin free glass bottles and stored at -80 \u00b0C pending analysis. While others have reported heparin tubes to increase endotoxin levels [ 48 , 49 ] and hydrophobic polymers to bind LPS [ 50 ], in this case, limited storage for 3 h was not found to have an impact on the analysis with no detectable level above the limit of detection.\nWe acknowledge several potential weaknesses in our study. Laugerette et al. suggested sonication would disperse the aggregates of LPS into smaller and more uniform particles to enhance detection [ 31 ]. The lack of correlation between this measure of LPS and LBP suggest the conditions in our study were insufficient to completely reduce this aggregation; (Digital Pulse Swept Power operating at 43 kHz \u00b1 2 kHz sweep bandwidth with 20 Hz pulses). The study also failed to control for the possible presence of proteases and glucans; it is possible that proteases [ 50 , 51 ] or glucans [ 26 ], if present in sufficient quantities in the blood, could have inhibited the clotting cascade in the LAL assay. The recovery of LPS from serum after it has bound to lipoproteins is also challenging. While some suggest that re-extraction of plasma using chloroform could be used to release LPS from inhibitory proteins and lipoproteins [ 52 ], others report as little as ~0.001% of the spiked biological activity is recovered using this method [ 53 ], suggesting that even after additional preparative work, the majority of LPS in the circulation residing in lipoproteins was not detectable by the LAL assay.\n"], "ner": [[], [[1087, 1094, "DISEASE"]], [], [], [], [], []], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "sentences": ["\nMetabolic endotoxemia is increasingly reported in the literature, yet there is no gold standard method of analysis for low levels of circulating endotoxins.

{"doc_key": "7345849_2. Materials and Methods", "text": ["\n2.1. Participant Recruitment\nMen aged 18 to 50 years with a BMI > 25 kg/m\u00b2 were recruited as part of a larger study (South Australian Medical Research Institute (SAMRI), Adelaide, South Australia) over a 3-month period in 2018. This overweight group was targeted as they have been reported to more likely exhibit ME [ 30 , 31 , 32 ], thereby having detectable levels of LPS in plasma. Men with an inflammatory or infective disease and consuming immunosuppressive medication (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroids, or fish oil) or supplements that may alter intestinal function (e.g., probiotics, antibiotics in the last month) were excluded. The study was approved by the University of South Australia Human Research Ethics Committee in December 2018 (approval number: 200913).\n2.2. Anthropometric Measurements\nAnthropometric measures were collected. Height was measured to the nearest 1 cm (Seca, 216, Germany). Weight was measured using a bio-electrical impedance scale (Tanita, UM051, Tanita Corporation of America Inc. Arlington Heights, IL, USA). BMI was calculated using the equation body weight (kg)/height (m 2 ) and classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) ranges; underweight (<18.50 kg/m 2 ), normal weight (18.50-24.99 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25.00-29.99 kg/m 2 ) and obese (>30 kg/m 2 ) [ 33 ].\n2.3. Blood Collection\nA trained phlebotomist collected venous blood samples into a plastic serum vacuette tube (9 mL, cat no: Lithium Heparin; Greiner, Kremsm\u00fcnster,  Austria ), which we had shown to be free of endotoxin. All samples were allowed to clot for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at 3500  g  at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min (Hettich Universal 320R, Geldermalsen, Netherlands). Raw plasma was decanted into pyrogen free tubes (cat: 80-507 USP Type 1 flint borosilicate glass tubes with caps; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) using pyrogen free pipette tips (Cat; BE10051, Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Aliquots of raw serum were stored at -80 \u00b0C [ 32 ] pending further analysis.\n2.4. Assessment of Metabolic Endotoxemia\n\n           2.4.1. Limulus Amebocyte (LAL) Assay  \n           Preparation of Standards \n             Supplementary Table S1 . To prepare standards, a control standard endotoxin (CSE) bottle (Lonza Group Ltd., Walkersville, MD, USA) was reconstituted with LAL reagent water (LRW; lot no. 0000638444, exp: 21/06/2019; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) to make a 50 EU/mL solution. Serial dilutions were prepared in pyrogen free glass tubes (Cat: N207; Lonza, USA; 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, 0.003, 0.002, and 0.001 EU/mL) according to  \n           \n             \n           Preparations of Plasma Samples \n             Supplementary Table S2 . To inactivate endotoxin-neutralizing agents that inhibit endotoxin activity in the assay, a heat treatment and dilution protocol was employed. Samples were thawed to room temperature and a dry block heater (Ratek, Victoria, Australia) was pre-heated to 70 \u00b0C or 80 \u00b0C.

A second instrument was also used in the analysis (Enspire, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA with accompanying software, USA) under the following conditions: incubation in a micro-plate reader for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. One hundred microliters of freshly prepared LAL reagent was added to each well. The plate was shaken for 30 s and the OD of each sample was read at 405 nm immediately after shaking and every 40 s thereafter for a total of 200 reading (133 min). The reaction time was defined, as recommended by the manufacturer, as the time taken for OD to increase by 0.2 units from the initial (baseline) OD value of either standards or samples (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Polynomial models were generated in Microsoft Excel 2010 based on the reaction times in seconds of a series of endotoxin concentrations between 0.001 and 50 EU/mL in LRW. Kinetic-QCL\u2122 LAL kits from a single batch were used in the study (lot TL067Y5MJJ, exp:7/6/2020). The assay also used a Lonza micro-plate reader (ELX808LBS) which was calibrated by a Lonza representative at 405 nm (R = 0.999, slope = 1.656, y intercept = -0.068). One hundred microliters of each sample or standard were pipetted into a 96-well micro-plate (Cat no: 25-340; Lonza Walkersville, MD, USA) in duplicate. In addition, a further aliquot of 100 \u00b5L of sample, then a further 10 \u00b5L of 5 EU/mL standard in the same well was prepared in duplicate to create a 0.5 EU/mL spike in into the sample. This formed the positive product control (PPC). The plate was incubated in a micro-plate reader for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. One hundred microliters of freshly prepared LAL reagent was added to each well.

{"doc_key": "7345849_1. Introduction", "text": ["\nEndotoxin, also known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is derived from the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane and consists of three key components; the O antigen, core oligosaccharide, and the lipid-A molecule [ 1 ]. These components may facilitate potent activation of innate immunity when triggered by low-grade endotoxemia, as demonstrated by the lipid-A molecule's interaction with the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), mediating expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 1 ]. The potentiation of a pro-inflammatory state via low presence of endotoxins may progress to the onset of inflammatory diseases [ 2 , 3 ]. The precise levels of endotoxin capable of damaging human health remains unclear, however modestly raised levels of endotoxins in human circulation have been increasingly linked in numerous studies to poor health and diseases such as; cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis [ 3 , 4 ], insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [ 2 ], and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [ 5 ].\nCurrently, there are three very different analytical techniques to assess human endotoxin levels; the Limulus amebocyte assay (LAL assay), the lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) assay and the endotoxin activity assay (EAA\u2122), which we have previously demonstrated is not suitable for use under conditions of metabolic endotoxemia (ME) [ 5 ]. The LBPenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ( ELISA) assay provides an indirect measurement of sub-acute endotoxin which has been designed specifically for biological samples and measures an acute-phase reactant protein, predominantly produced by the liver, in response to endotoxin exposure [ 6 ]. The biological role of LBP is to deliver endotoxin to a co-receptor CD14, facilitating an interaction between endotoxin and TLR4, triggering a signaling cascade. This ultimately results in up-regulation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 7 , 8 ]. The LBP has been used extensively to detect low levels of ME associated with obesity (body mass index; BMI) [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ]. LBP in serum has also been used to detect endotoxemia in inflammatory bowel conditions, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and sepsis (reviewed in [ 14 ]). However, the use of an indirect measurement may not be ideal for analyzing rapid changes in LPS exposure, such as postprandial endotoxemia, as the LBP response to endotoxin exposure is delayed and the accuracy of the test is dependent on normal hepatic function for production of the measured binding protein [ 15 ].\nIn contrast, there are three LAL assays which offer a direct measurement of endotoxin through initiating a blood clotting cascade, as Limulus polyphemus clots with Gram-negative bacteria during infection [ 16 ]. The most commonly used LAL assay is a chromogenic test. Briefly, the conversion of a pro-enzyme to its active form is catalyzed by endotoxin, which then splits p-nitroaniline (pNA) from a colorless substrate, which is quantified by the time taken for the optical density (OD) to increase by 0.2 OD at 405 nm and is quantitatively proportional to the concentration of endotoxin in the sample (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). The LAL assay's ability to assess endotoxin under conditions of sepsis is undisputed, however the manufacturer cautions that the assay was \"not meant for testing blood or blood products, nor are they meant to diagnose, treat, or mitigate any disease or condition such as endotoxemia in man or animals\" [ 17 ]. This is because inhibitors of the LAL assay present in complex biological samples, such as blood, interfere with endotoxin identification, particularly at low levels. Despite this, a number of research groups have quantified acute short-term changes in plasma endotoxin in healthy individuals before and after the ingestion of a fatty meal using the LAL assay [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ]. However, none of these research groups have verified the accuracy of the determinations under postprandial ME. Additionally, there is a lack of consistency in the methodology employed under conditions of ME, namely in the variable dilution rates and heat treatments required for adequate inhibition of chemical interferences such as beta-glucan [ 26 ], or protein modification in blood [ 27 , 28 ]. Therefore, with significant research interest on the effect of low levels of endotoxin exposure on health [ 29 ], there is a need to establish a gold standard assay to directly test for ME, thereby advancing research the field.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate whether the LAL chromogenic assay was suitable to detect endotoxins under conditions of ME and if so, to then optimize the conditions of use and validate it against BMI, an established marker of ME and an established assay under conditions of fasting. This would provide a validated direct measure of ME which could be used to evaluate postprandial changes in ME during feeding studies.\n"], "ner": [[[390, 410, "GENE"], [412, 416, "GENE"], [850, 872, "DISEASE"], [877, 892, "DISEASE"], [927, 942, "DISEASE"], [954, 987, "DISEASE"]], [[1707, 1711, "GENE"], [1763, 1767, "GENE"], [1975, 1982, "DISEASE"], [2121, 2133, "DISEASE"]], [], []], "relations": [[], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3], "sentences": ["\nEndotoxin, also known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is derived from the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane and consists of three key components; the O antigen, core oligosaccharide, and the lipid-A molecule [ 1 ].

However, the assay was not intended to assess plasma at levels typically seen in ME. We aimed to optimize and validate the LAL assay under a range of pre-treatment conditions against the well-established lipopolysaccharide binding protein assay (LBP). Fifteen healthy overweight and obese males aged 28.8 \u00b1 9.1years provided plasma. The LAL assay employed a range of pre-treatments; 70 \u00b0C for 15 and 30 min and 80 \u00b0C for 15 and 30 min, ultrasonication (70 \u00b0C for 10 min and then 40 \u00b0C for 10 min), and dilution (1:50, 1:75, 1:100, and 1:200 parts) or diluted using 0.5% pyrosperse.

{"doc_key": "8791029_Results", "text": ["\nProgranulin Expression, Knockdown, and Over-Expression in NSC-34 Cells\nNSC-34 vector control cells, and cells that either stably over-express human PGRN (NSC-34/hPGRN) or under-express murine PGRN (NSC-34/shPGRN) were generated ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). PGRN levels were depleted by approximately 50% in NSC-34/shPGRN cells, a reduction equivalent to that associated with FTD-GRN ( Supplementary Figures 1A,B ). To confirm their neuron-like identity NSC-34 cells were stained for the motor neuron marker SMI32, which recognizes dephosphorylated epitopes of neurofilaments ( Supplementary Figure 1C ). Neither depletion nor over-expression of PGRN altered TDP-43 mRNA or protein expression ( Supplementary Figure 1D ).\nProgranulin Regulates NSC-34 Cell Neurite Outgrowth, Morphology, and Survival\nProgranulin expression had a strong impact on the shape and size of the cell body. At 48 h of culture, cell bodies of NSC-34/hPGRN have greater area and are flattened compared to the controls and NSC-34/shPGRN cells, which are typically small and circular ( Figures 1A,B ). Neurite length was greater in NSC-34/hPGRN cells than control or NSC-34/shPGRN cells when serum was present (10 or 1%). Extension in NSC-34/shPGRN often appeared to be poorly condensed and disorganized, which we refer to as \"tortuous\" ( Figures 1A,B ). Serum-deprivation stimulates differentiation in NSC-34 cells ( Eggett et al., 2000 ) and, correspondingly, over an 8 day period in the absence of serum, all cells exhibited neurite extension with no significant difference detected in neurite length between NSC-34/hPGRN and NSC-34/shPGRN cells ( Figure 1C ). Extensive cell death occurs in the NSC-34/shPGRN cells after 8 days in serum free medium, at which point measurements were discontinued. PGRN is secreted but also localizes cytoplasmically, due, at least in part, to endocytosis into lysosomes ( Hu et al., 2010 ;  Petoukhov et al., 2013 ;  Zhou et al., 2015 ,  2017 ). Neurons secrete PGRN in an activity dependent manner ( Petoukhov et al., 2013 ). There are in addition multiple paracrine extracellular sources of PGRN including microglia ( Ryan et al., 2009 ;  Hu et al., 2010 ) and de-differentiated Schwann cells ( Hyung et al., 2019 ). We therefore tested whether extracellular PGRN, mimicking the secreted protein, reproduces the morphological and survival phenotypes associated with endogenous PGRN expression. Exogenous PGRN added to the medium reproduced the effects of stable PGRN expression as WT NSC-34 cells displayed longer neurite outgrowth compared to cells cultured without PGRN on nitrocellulose coated plates pre-treated with PGRN in the presence of 10% serum ( Figure 1D ). Cell survival of NSC-34/shPGRN cells in 8-day serum-reduced culture decreased relative to WT NSC-34 cells as expected ( Ryan et al., 2009 ), but adding PGRN to the medium restores NSC-34/shPGRN cell numbers to the levels of control NSC-34 cells ( Figure 1E ).\nGene Expression Profiling\nGiven that the cells undergo active morphological differentiation within 2 days incubation in 1% serum with no loss of viability ( Figure 1 ), all subsequent molecular analyzes were performed under these conditions. Gene expression microarrays were used to identify how the mRNA phenotype of NSC-34 cells responds to PGRN expression levels. The anticipated expression level of PGRN were confirmed in each of the NSC-34/shPGRN, control and NSC-34/hPGRN cell lines prior to the analysis ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). Genes showing statistically significant changes in expression were identified by FlexAarray analysis software. Principal component analysis confirmed that the data from each of NSC-34/shPGRN, NSC-34/hPGRN and vector controls cells segregates independently ( Supplementary Figure 2B ). Among genes that showed the greatest fold down-regulation in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared to NSC-34/hPGRN cells ( Table 1 ) were several associated with neurotransmission (dopamine decarboxylase, vesicular GABA transporter, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor), cytoskeletal organization (Stathmin 2, FGD2, SRGAP3), and RNA-binding proteins with roles in neuron development, survival, or congenital motor disorders (IGF2BP1, TSHZ1, GLE1).\n\n           TABLE 1 \n           Top 20 down-regulated genes in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared with NSC-34/hPGRN cells. \n           \n             \n           Gene symbol \n                 Gene and implication \n                 Fold change (down regulated) \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n             HMCN1 \n                 Hemicentin-1 \n                 6.18 \n               \n                 \n               TTF1 \n                 Transcription termination factor 1 \n                 5.05 \n               \n                 \n               WFDC3 \n                 WAP four-disulfide core domain protein \n                 5.01 \n               \n                 \n               SDSL \n                 Serine dehydratase-like \n                 3.74 \n               \n                 \n               STC1 \n                 stanniocalcin \n                 3.69 \n               \n                 \n               IGF2BP1 \n                 Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein1 Axonal outgrowth 1 \n                 3.58 \n               \n                 \n               DDC \n                 dopamine decarboxylase \n                 3.44 \n               \n                 \n               STRA6 \n                 Stimulated by retinoic acid 6 \n                 3.08 \n               \n                 \n               STMN2 \n                 Stathmin 2 \n                 2.75 \n               \n                 \n               SLC32A1 \n                 Vesicular GABA transporter \n                 2.65 \n               \n                 \n               FGD2 \n                 RhoGEF and PH domain containing 2 CDC42- specific exchange factor \n                 2.63 \n               \n                 \n               6430517E21RIK \n                 Similar to human fam5b \n                 2.54 \n               \n                 \n               ADRA2A \n                 Alpha-2-Adrenergic receptor \n                 2.53 \n               \n                 \n               SRGAP3 \n                 Slit-Robo Rho GTPase-activating protein 3 Severe mental retardation \n                 2.49 \n               \n                 \n               TSHZ1 \n                 Teashirt zinc finger homeobox 1 Motor neuron development, survival and function \n                 2.49 \n               \n                 \n               CES1 \n                 Carboxylesterase 1 \n                 2.47 \n               \n                 \n               DKK1 \n                 Dickkopf-related protein 1 \n                 2.47 \n               \n                 \n               4933405K21RIK \n                 GLE1A and GLE1B RNA export mediator Lethal congenital contracture syndrome and ALS \n                 2.46 \n               \n                 \n               2310005C01RIK \n                 neuronal nitric oxide synthase \n                 2.43 \n               \n                 \n               EG433865 \n                 similar to spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase \n                 2.42 \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n           Azzouz et al., 2002 ;  Bucheler et al., 2002 ;  Johnson et al., 2003 ), cytoskeletal organization (Stathmin 2, FGD2, SRGAP3) ( Endris et al., 2002 ;  Budhachandra et al., 2008 ;  Hayakawa et al., 2008 ;  Carlson et al., 2011 ;  Klim et al., 2019 ) and RNA-binding proteins with roles in neuron development, survival, or congenital motor disorders (IGF2BP1, TSHZ1, GLE1) ( Nousiainen et al., 2008 ;  Gaynes et al., 2015 ;  Zhang et al., 2018 ;  Chaimowicz et al., 2019 ). Note the presence of genes associated with neurotransmission, cytoskeletal organization, and congenital neurological disorders. Among genes that showed the greatest fold down-regulation in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared to NSC-34/hPGRN cells were several associated with neurotransmission (dopamine decarboxylase, vesicular GABA transporter, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor) ( \n \n \n             \n               \n           \n             \n        \nIngenuity Pathway analysis identified potential PGRN-sensitive functional networks ( Table 2 ). Among \"biological function\" networks PGRN knockdown was associated with neurological disease, behavior and nervous system development and function. The strong neurological disease-related signature in the downregulated data set of NSC-34/shPGRN cells implies that they exhibit disease-relevant molecular signals of neuronal disturbance, and this data set was, therefore, prioritized for further analysis. The top five IPA Associated Network Functions for PGRN knockdown cells versus PGRN over-expressors, based on a 1.5-fold cutoff difference for transcript expression, are given in  Table 3 . Details of each of the IPA Associated Network Functions are given in  Supplementary Figure 3 . Manual inspection of IPA network 1 predicts a potential sub-network associated with histone remodeling. Network 2 predicts two sub-networks associated with sterol metabolism and triglyceride metabolism, respectively. Network 4 predicts a sub-network associated with activation of RNA polymerase or RNA processing and Network 5 predicts two possible sub-networks associated with neuronal voltage-activated calcium channel ion-pore structure or regulation, and synaptic neurotransmitter vesicle formation/exocytosis.\n\n           TABLE 2 \n           Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of Top Predicted Biological Functions associated with knockdown or over-expression of PGRN in NSC-34 cells. \n           \n             \n           Treatment groups \n                 Top scoring IPA biological functions \n               \n                 \n               \n                 Diseases and disorders \n                 Molecular and cellular functions \n                 Physiological system development and function \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n             NSC-34/shPGRN vs vector control NSC-34- DOWN \n                 Neurological Disease \n                 Cell Morphology \n                 Behavior \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 4.95E-06-2.20E-02 \n                 p  value 1.34E-05-1.92E-02 \n                 p  value 5.25E-06-2.04E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 128 \n                 # molecules 121 \n                 # molecules 56 \n               \n                 \n               NSC-34/shPGRN vs NSC-34/hPGRN DOWN \n                 Neurological Disease \n                 Lipid Metabolism \n                 Nervous System Development and Function \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 1.08E-05-1.99E-02 \n                 p  value 1.67E-05-1.87E-02 \n                 p  value 3.89E-06-1.94E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 108 \n                 # molecules 74 \n                 # molecules 118 \n               \n                 \n               NSC-34/shPGRN vs vector control NSC-34- UP \n                 Cardiovascular Disease \n                 Cellular Growth and Proliferation \n                 Embryonic Development \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 1.38E-06-1.23E-02 \n                 p  value 1.11E-05-1.21E-02 \n                 p  value 1.56E-06-1.16E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 67 \n                 # molecules 148 \n                 # molecules 106 \n               \n                 \n               NSC-34/shPGRN vs NSC-34/hPGRN - UP \n                 Cancer \n                 Cellular Growth and Proliferation \n                 Cardiovascular System Development and Function \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 1.98E-09-1.56E-02 \n                 p  value 4.74E-07-1.50E-02 \n                 p  value 2.09E-05-1.56E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 172 \n                 # molecules 147 \n                 # molecules 63 \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n           Note that molecules that decrease when PGRN is knocked down have a predicted association with neurological disease, behavior and nervous system development and function.

The DAVID analyses were stratified into: (i) signals that are downregulated in PGRN knockdown cells versus PGRN overexpressing cells; (ii) signals that are down regulated in PGRN knockdown cells with respect both to PGRN overexpressing cells and control cells (\"commons\"); (iii) the \"neuronal commons,\" that is genes extracted from the \"common\" subset that have a well-defined CNS function assessed by manually surveying their entries in the Uniprot, Genecards and OMIM databases. 657 genes in total go down in the [shPGRN vs hPGRN] gene set. The common gene set [shPGRN vs CTL/hPGRN] contains 264 molecules (40% of all down-regulated genes in the [shPGRN vs hPGRN] gene set). There are 55 genes in the \"neuronal commons\" gene subset, representing one fifth (20.8%) of the common gene set. Predicted functional annotation clustering is given in  Figure 2A  for clusters with an enrichment score of one or above. The top 10 most enriched individual GO-terms are given in  Figure 2B . Both the cluster analysis and individual GO-terms indicate effects on synaptic function in the NSC-34/shPGRN cells (compare with IPA network 5,  Supplementary Figure 3 ), associated, in particular, with synaptic vesicle cycling and SNARE interactions in vesicular transport and neuron projection. Functional annotation clustering ( Figure 2A ) and the list of top individual GO terms ( Figure 2B ) also show a strong signal for sterol biosynthetic pathways (compare with IPA network 2,  Supplementary Figure 3 ).\nThe top GO-terms and annotation clusters that are upregulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells relative to both control cells and PGRN over-expressing cells (commons-up) are summarized in  Supplementary Table 2 . This revealed several signals for neuron-related terms, but, rather than being centered on synaptic structural functions, as was observed among the down-regulated data set ( Figure 2 ), the up-regulated terms are related to semaphorin signaling and extracellular axon guidance pathways. The GO term \"membrane\" was enriched in both the down-regulated ( Figure 2B ) and up-regulated transcript data sets ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Among the molecules included in the two \"membrane\" GO terms (up and down regulated), are many with receptor-like properties ( Table 4 ). Substantially more signals for receptor tyrosine kinase transcripts (AXL, EPHB4, NGFR, and PDGFRB) are up-regulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared to those that are down-regulated (RET). Similarly signals for molecules in the semaphorin-signaling pathway (NRP1, NRP2, PLXNA1, SEMA7A, SEMA6B), Notch-related receptors (NOTCH1 and NOTCH4), and receptors- in the Wnt-signaling pathway (FZD3, FZD7, LGR6) were up-regulated when PGRN was depleted. In comparison, the number of differentially regulated G-protein linked receptor mRNAs in either the up- or the down-regulated groups is similar (5 vs 6). Receptor-like proteins associated with the immune response were down-regulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells (CD109, CD180, CD40, Fc receptor IgA IgM, CSF2RA, TREML1, and TNFSF8). Although PGRN is a powerful survival agent in NSC-34 cells we did not detect any signals associated with apoptosis or its inhibition in NSC-34/shPGRN cells. This is, however, unsurprising as the conditions chosen for the gene expression analyses were not associated with extensive cell death.\n\n           TABLE 4 \n           A comparison of membrane

Gene Expression\nThe reduced expression of genes involved in the neuronal cytoskeleton and neurotransmission in cells with depleted PGRN expression was confirmed by RT-PCR ( Figure 3A ). This is consistent with a role for PGRN expression in the maintenance of a differentiated state in NSC-34 cells ( Figure 3A ). Interestingly, there was often little difference in mRNA expression between control and NSC-34/hPGRN cells. We tested specifically for active growth cone formation using growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43, also called neuromodulin) ( Maier et al., 2013 ), and, for evidence of cholinergic differentiation using vesicular acetylcholine transporter (SLC18A3) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) as markers ( Figure 3B ). Expression of GAP-43, and SLC18A3 cells were unchanged between control and NSC-34/hPGRN cells but were decreased in NSC-34/shPGRN, further supporting a role for PGRN in supporting neuron-like structural differentiation in NSC-34 cells. In contrast ChAT mRNA levels, were unaffected by PGRN depletion. Increased expression of neurotrophic receptor transcripts in NSC-34/shPGRN cells was confirmed, with strong signals observed for NGFR (nerve growth factor receptor) and FZD3 (Frizzled 3, a wnt receptor) ( Figure 3C ). A concerted change in genes associated with lipid metabolism was confirmed ( Figure 3D ) with most genes downregulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared to control or NSC-34/hPGRN cells as predicted. Not all lipid metabolism genes were downregulated, however, as mRNA for ceramide synthase 2 (CER2) was strongly upregulated.\nNeither IPA nor DAVID predicted a strong lysosomal response to PGRN depletion even though deletion of PGRN results in altered expression of lysosomal genes and proteins in other cell lines and  Grn  knockout mice ( Tanaka et al., 2017 ;  Huang et al., 2020 ). To evaluate whether PGRN depletion alters lysosome gene expression in NSC-34 cells we measured the relative mRNA levels of the lysosome proteins lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and cathepsin D (CTSD). There was no indication of increased expression of these genes in NSC-34/shPGRN cells ( Figure 3E ), and an apparent decrease in expression of cathepsin D, which implies a lack of extensive lysosome biogenesis upon partial PGRN depletion in this model.\nLipid Groups Are Differentially Regulated in Progranulin Knockdown NSC-34 Cells\nSince the transcriptomic data suggested that lipid metabolic pathways are sensitive to PGRN depletion, we undertook mass spectrometric lipidomic analyses on NSC-34/shPGRN and NSC-34/hPGRN cells. Principal component analysis confirmed that all 3 replicates from the same cell construct segregate separately from the other constructs ( Supplementary Figure 4 ). High or low PGRN expression had no effect on the levels of the quantitatively dominant lipid groups ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, three lipid classes that are quantitatively less abundant, phosphatidic acid, ceramides and cholesteryl ester show upregulation of specific lipid members between high and low PGRN expressors ( Figures 4B-D ).\nInfluence of Progranulin on Protein Expression\nThe influence of PGRN expression on cellular protein composition was determined comparing NSC-34/hPGRN, NSC-34/shPGRN cells, and control cells, respectively ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). The largest variability was detected between PGRN enriched NSC-34/hPGRN cells and NSC-34/shPGRN knockdown cells. Enrichment of GO and Kegg terms identified functional annotation clusters associated with cell adhesion, and metabolism ( Figures 5A,B ). Functional annotation clusters ( Figure 5C ) and enriched GO terms ( Figure 5D ) for proteins that were overexpressed in NSC-34/shPGRN cells were linked to cell adhesion, RNA binding, RNA processing and metabolism.\nProgranulin Binds to Multiple Membrane Proteins Both on the Cell Surface and in the Endoplasmic Reticulum/Golgi/Lysosome Network\nAs the observed PGRN-dependent phenotypes in NSC-34 cells are reproduced by extracellular PGRN ( Figures 1D,E ), implying an action on extracellular membrane proteins ( Chitramuthu et al., 2017a ;  Paushter et al., 2018 ), we therefore extended the proteomic analysis to probe specifically for potential PGRN membrane binding proteins using a LRC proteomic strategy ( Frei et al., 2012 ,  2013 ;  Figure 6A ). In total 1746 glycopeptides were identified and quantified. Of these, the cut-off criterion employed for inclusion as putative PGRN-binders was a log2 fold binding enrichment > 0.6 (which is equivalent to an approximately 1.5-fold change in absolute values), and a  p  value < 0.02 ( Supplementary Table 3 ). This yields 33 proteins. Most of the putative PGRN-binding proteins are associated with the plasma membrane, ER, or lysosome membranes ( Figure 6B ). Applying STRING analysis to this data set generated a potential interaction network of candidate lysosomal PGRN binding proteins that includes sortilin (SORT1, log2 fold enrichment 1.00 or 2 in natural numbers) and prosaposin (PSAP, log2 enrichment 0.716 or 1.64 in natural numbers) ( Figure 6C ). GO analysis of biological processes gave the highest score for lysosomal transport ( Figure 6D ). The presence of ER/Golgi/lysosome proteins is likely to be due to their exposure on the cell surface rather than uptake of labeled PGRN into the cells as the binding experiments were all conducted at 4\u00b0C. The highest scoring plasma membrane protein ( Supplementary Table 3 ) was the tetraspanin TSPAN4 (log2 fold enhancement 3.96 or 15.5-fold in natural numbers). A second tetraspanin, TSPAN31 (log2 fold enhancement 1.86 or 3.6-fold in natural numbers), was also captured. Two members of the RTK-family, RET (log2 fold enrichment 1.25 or 2.4-fold in natural numbers), which is the kinase subunit of the glial cell-derived nerve growth factor (GDNF) receptor, and PTK7 (protein tyrosine kinase 7, log2 fold enrichment 0.942875 or 1.92-fold in natural numbers), which is an inactive RTK homolog. In the insulin-binding control arm, multiple peptides for insulin (INSR) were identified (log2 fold enrichment 2.23 or 4.69 in natural values).\nProgranulin Increases Activity of Different Receptor Tyrosine Kinases in Different Cell Types\nReceptor phosphotyrosine antibody arrays were employed to screen for RTKs that are sensitive to PGRN expression levels ( Figure 7A ). RET, PDGFR-alpha (Platelet derived growth factor -alpha), Mer, and weakly, TrkA (high affinity nerve growth factor receptor), MusK (Muscle-Specific Kinase), and EphA3 (EPH Receptor A3) were more highly tyrosine phosphorylated in NSC-34/hPGRN cells than in vector controls or NSC-34/shPGRN knockdown cells ( Figure 7B ). Other reports, using the same phosphotyrosine receptor array screening technique, but analyzing non-neuronal cells, revealed that EphA2 was the likely RTK target for PGRN ( Neill et al., 2016 ). Given that EphA3 phosphorylation is only weakly enhanced by PGRN expression in NSC-343 cells, we tested PGRN in MDA-MD-468 mammary epithelial cells and detected phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and ErbB2 (an EGF-receptor family member), as well as members of the EphA family of receptors ( Figure 7A ). PGRN expression, therefore, activates different sets of tyrosine kinase receptors in different cell types implying cell context-dependent signaling. The antibody array results were validated by Western blot analyses using phospho-receptor specific antibodies ( Figures 7C,D ). RET expression is greatly reduced in NSC-34/shPGRN cells, suggesting that at least some of the differences observed in receptor RET tyrosine phosphorylation reflect differential expression of the RET protein, as was also predicted from the mRNA microarray analyses.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 12, "GENE"], [149, 153, "GENE"], [163, 167, "GENE"], [193, 197, "GENE"], [208, 212, "GENE"], [257, 261, "GENE"],

cells that either stably over-express human PGRN (NSC-34/hPGRN) or under-express murine PGRN (NSC-34/shPGRN) were generated ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). PGRN levels were depleted by approximately 50% in NSC-34/shPGRN cells, a reduction equivalent to that associated with FTD-GRN ( Supplementary Figures 1A,B ). To confirm their neuron-like identity NSC-34 cells were stained for the motor neuron marker SMI32, which recognizes dephosphorylated epitopes of neurofilaments ( Supplementary Figure 1C ). Neither depletion nor over-expression of PGRN altered TDP-43 mRNA or protein expression ( Supplementary Figure 1D ).\n", "Progranulin Regulates NSC-34 Cell Neurite Outgrowth, Morphology, and Survival\nProgranulin expression had a strong impact on the shape and size of the cell body. At 48 h of culture, cell bodies of NSC-34/hPGRN have greater area and are flattened compared to the controls and NSC-34/shPGRN cells, which are typically small and circular ( Figures 1A,B ). Neurite length was greater in NSC-34/hPGRN cells than control or NSC-34/shPGRN cells when serum was present (10 or 1%). Extension in NSC-34/shPGRN often appeared to be poorly condensed and disorganized, which we refer to as \"tortuous\" ( Figures 1A,B ). Serum-deprivation stimulates differentiation in NSC-34 cells ( Eggett et al., 2000 ) and, correspondingly, over an 8 day period in the absence of serum, all cells exhibited neurite extension with no significant difference detected in neurite length between NSC-34/hPGRN and NSC-34/shPGRN cells ( Figure 1C ). Extensive cell death occurs in the NSC-34/shPGRN cells after 8 days in serum free medium, at which point measurements were discontinued. PGRN is secreted but also localizes cytoplasmically, due, at least in part, to endocytosis into lysosomes ( Hu et al., 2010 ;  Petoukhov et al., 2013 ;  Zhou et al., 2015 ,  2017 ). Neurons secrete PGRN in an activity dependent manner ( Petoukhov et al., 2013 ). There are in addition multiple paracrine extracellular sources of PGRN including microglia ( Ryan et al., 2009 ;  Hu et al., 2010 ) and de-differentiated Schwann cells ( Hyung et al., 2019 ). We therefore tested whether extracellular PGRN, mimicking the secreted protein, reproduces the morphological and survival phenotypes associated with endogenous PGRN expression. Exogenous PGRN added to the medium reproduced the effects of stable PGRN expression as WT NSC-34 cells displayed longer neurite outgrowth compared to cells cultured without PGRN on nitrocellulose coated plates pre-treated with PGRN in the presence of 10% serum ( Figure 1D ). Cell survival of NSC-34/shPGRN cells in 8-day serum-reduced culture decreased relative to WT NSC-34 cells as expected ( Ryan et al., 2009 ), but adding PGRN to the medium restores NSC-34/shPGRN cell numbers to the levels of control NSC-34 cells ( Figure 1E ).\n", "Gene Expression Profiling\nGiven that the cells undergo active morphological differentiation within 2 days incubation in 1% serum with no loss of viability ( Figure 1 ), all subsequent molecular analyzes were performed under these conditions. Gene expression microarrays were used to identify how the mRNA phenotype of NSC-34 cells responds to PGRN expression levels. The anticipated expression level of PGRN were confirmed in each of the NSC-34/shPGRN, control and NSC-34/hPGRN cell lines prior to the analysis ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). Genes showing statistically significant changes in expression were identified by FlexAarray analysis software. Principal component analysis confirmed that the data from each of NSC-34/shPGRN, NSC-34/hPGRN and vector controls cells segregates independently ( Supplementary Figure 2B ). Among genes that showed the greatest fold down-regulation in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared to NSC-34/hPGRN cells ( Table 1 ) were several associated with neurotransmission (dopamine decarboxylase, vesicular GABA transporter, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor), cytoskeletal organization (Stathmin 2, FGD2, SRGAP3), and RNA-binding proteins with roles in neuron development, survival, or congenital motor disorders (IGF2BP1, TSHZ1, GLE1).\n", "\n           TABLE 1 \n           Top 20 down-regulated genes in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared with NSC-34/hPGRN cells. \n", "           \n             \n           Gene symbol \n                 Gene and implication \n                 Fold change (down regulated) \n", "               \n                 \n             \n               \n             HMCN1 \n                 Hemicentin-1 \n", "                 6.18 \n               \n                 \n               TTF1 \n                 Transcription termination factor 1 \n", "                 5.05 \n               \n                 \n               WFDC3 \n                 WAP four-disulfide core domain protein \n", "                 5.01 \n               \n                 \n               SDSL \n                 Serine dehydratase-like \n", "                 3.74 \n               \n                 \n               STC1 \n                 stanniocalcin \n", "                 3.69 \n               \n                 \n               IGF2BP1 \n                 Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein1 Axonal outgrowth 1 \n", "                 3.58 \n               \n                 \n               DDC \n                 dopamine decarboxylase \n", "                 3.44 \n               \n                 \n               STRA6 \n                 Stimulated by retinoic acid 6 \n", "                 3.08 \n               \n                 \n               STMN2 \n                 Stathmin 2 \n", "                 2.75 \n               \n                 \n               SLC32A1 \n                 Vesicular GABA transporter \n                 2.65 \n               \n                 \n               FGD2 \n                 RhoGEF and PH domain containing 2 CDC42- specific exchange factor \n                 2.63 \n               \n                 \n               6430517E21RIK \n                 Similar to human fam5b \n                 2.54 \n               \n                 \n               ADRA2A \n                 Alpha-2-Adrenergic receptor \n                 2.53 \n               \n                 \n               SRGAP3 \n                 Slit-Robo Rho GTPase-activating protein 3 Severe mental retardation \n                 2.49 \n               \n                 \n               TSHZ1 \n                 Teashirt zinc finger homeobox 1 Motor neuron development, survival and function \n                 2.49 \n               \n                 \n               CES1 \n                 Carboxylesterase 1 \n                 2.47 \n               \n                 \n               DKK1 \n                 Dickkopf-related protein 1 \n                 2.47 \n               \n                 \n               4933405K21RIK \n                 GLE1A and GLE1B RNA export mediator Lethal congenital contracture syndrome and ALS \n                 2.46 \n               \n                 \n               2310005C01RIK \n                 neuronal nitric oxide synthase \n                 2.43 \n               \n                 \n               EG433865 \n                 similar to spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase \n                 2.42 \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n           Azzouz et al., 2002 ;  Bucheler et al., 2002 ;  Johnson et al., 2003 ), cytoskeletal organization (Stathmin 2, FGD2, SRGAP3) ( Endris et al., 2002 ;  Budhachandra et al., 2008 ;  Hayakawa et al., 2008 ;  Carlson et al., 2011 ;  Klim et al., 2019 ) and RNA-binding proteins with roles in neuron development, survival, or congenital motor disorders (IGF2BP1, TSHZ1, GLE1) ( Nousiainen et al., 2008 ;  Gaynes et al., 2015 ;  Zhang et al., 2018 ;  Chaimowicz et al., 2019 ).

Among \"biological function\" networks PGRN knockdown was associated with neurological disease, behavior and nervous system development and function. The strong neurological disease-related signature in the downregulated data set of NSC-34/shPGRN cells implies that they exhibit disease-relevant molecular signals of neuronal disturbance, and this data set was, therefore, prioritized for further analysis. The top five IPA Associated Network Functions for PGRN knockdown cells versus PGRN over-expressors, based on a 1.5-fold cutoff difference for transcript expression, are given in  Table 3 . Details of each of the IPA Associated Network Functions are given in  Supplementary Figure 3 . Manual inspection of IPA network 1 predicts a potential sub-network associated with histone remodeling. Network 2 predicts two sub-networks associated with sterol metabolism and triglyceride metabolism, respectively. Network 4 predicts a sub-network associated with activation of RNA polymerase or RNA processing and Network 5 predicts two possible sub-networks associated with neuronal voltage-activated calcium channel ion-pore structure or regulation, and synaptic neurotransmitter vesicle formation/exocytosis.\n", "\n           TABLE 2 \n           Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of Top Predicted Biological Functions associated with knockdown or over-expression of PGRN in NSC-34 cells. \n", "           \n             \n           Treatment groups \n                 Top scoring IPA biological functions \n               \n                 \n               \n                 Diseases and disorders \n                 Molecular and cellular functions \n                 Physiological system development and function \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n             NSC-34/shPGRN vs vector control NSC-34- DOWN \n                 Neurological Disease \n                 Cell Morphology \n                 Behavior \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 4.95E-06-2.20E-02 \n                 p  value 1.34E-05-1.92E-02 \n                 p  value 5.25E-06-2.04E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 128 \n                 # molecules 121 \n                 # molecules 56 \n               \n                 \n               NSC-34/shPGRN vs NSC-34/hPGRN DOWN \n                 Neurological Disease \n                 Lipid Metabolism \n                 Nervous System Development and Function \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 1.08E-05-1.99E-02 \n                 p  value 1.67E-05-1.87E-02 \n                 p  value 3.89E-06-1.94E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 108 \n                 # molecules 74 \n                 # molecules 118 \n               \n                 \n               NSC-34/shPGRN vs vector control NSC-34- UP \n                 Cardiovascular Disease \n                 Cellular Growth and Proliferation \n                 Embryonic Development \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 1.38E-06-1.23E-02 \n                 p  value 1.11E-05-1.21E-02 \n                 p  value 1.56E-06-1.16E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 67 \n                 # molecules 148 \n                 # molecules 106 \n               \n                 \n               NSC-34/shPGRN vs NSC-34/hPGRN - UP \n                 Cancer \n                 Cellular Growth and Proliferation \n                 Cardiovascular System Development and Function \n               \n                 \n               \n                 p  value 1.98E-09-1.56E-02 \n                 p  value 4.74E-07-1.50E-02 \n                 p  value 2.09E-05-1.56E-02 \n               \n                 \n               \n                 # molecules 172 \n                 # molecules 147 \n                 # molecules 63 \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n           Note that molecules that decrease when PGRN is knocked down have a predicted association with neurological disease, behavior and nervous system development and function.

The DAVID analyses were stratified into: (i) signals that are downregulated in PGRN knockdown cells versus PGRN overexpressing cells; (ii) signals that are down regulated in PGRN knockdown cells with respect both to PGRN overexpressing cells and control cells (\"commons\"); (iii) the \"neuronal commons,\" that is genes extracted from the \"common\" subset that have a well-defined CNS function assessed by manually surveying their entries in the Uniprot, Genecards and OMIM databases. 657 genes in total go down in the [shPGRN vs hPGRN] gene set. The common gene set [shPGRN vs CTL/hPGRN] contains 264 molecules (40% of all down-regulated genes in the [shPGRN vs hPGRN] gene set). There are 55 genes in the \"neuronal commons\" gene subset, representing one fifth (20.8%) of the common gene set. Predicted functional annotation clustering is given in  Figure 2A  for clusters with an enrichment score of one or above. The top 10 most enriched individual GO-terms are given in  Figure 2B . Both the cluster analysis and individual GO-terms indicate effects on synaptic function in the NSC-34/shPGRN cells (compare with IPA network 5,  Supplementary Figure 3 ), associated, in particular, with synaptic vesicle cycling and SNARE interactions in vesicular transport and neuron projection. Functional annotation clustering ( Figure 2A ) and the list of top individual GO terms ( Figure 2B ) also show a strong signal for sterol biosynthetic pathways (compare with IPA network 2,  Supplementary Figure 3 ).\n", "The top GO-terms and annotation clusters that are upregulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells relative to both control cells and PGRN over-expressing cells (commons-up) are summarized in  Supplementary Table 2 . This revealed several signals for neuron-related terms, but, rather than being centered on synaptic structural functions, as was observed among the down-regulated data set ( Figure 2 ), the up-regulated terms are related to semaphorin signaling and extracellular axon guidance pathways. The GO term \"membrane\" was enriched in both the down-regulated ( Figure 2B ) and up-regulated transcript data sets ( Supplementary Table 2 ). Among the molecules included in the two \"membrane\" GO terms (up and down regulated), are many with receptor-like properties ( Table 4 ). Substantially more signals for receptor tyrosine kinase transcripts (AXL, EPHB4, NGFR, and PDGFRB) are up-regulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared to those that are down-regulated (RET). Similarly signals for molecules in the semaphorin-signaling pathway (NRP1, NRP2, PLXNA1, SEMA7A, SEMA6B), Notch-related receptors (NOTCH1 and NOTCH4), and receptors- in the Wnt-signaling pathway (FZD3, FZD7, LGR6) were up-regulated when PGRN was depleted. In comparison, the number of differentially regulated G-protein linked receptor mRNAs in either the up- or the down-regulated groups is similar (5 vs 6). Receptor-like proteins associated with the immune response were down-regulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells (CD109, CD180, CD40, Fc receptor IgA IgM, CSF2RA, TREML1, and TNFSF8). Although PGRN is a powerful survival agent in NSC-34 cells we did not detect any signals associated with apoptosis or its inhibition in NSC-34/shPGRN cells. This is, however, unsurprising as the conditions chosen for the gene expression analyses were not associated with extensive cell death.\n", "\n           TABLE 4 \n           A comparison of membrane

neurotransmission in cells with depleted PGRN expression was confirmed by RT-PCR ( Figure 3A ). This is consistent with a role for PGRN expression in the maintenance of a differentiated state in NSC-34 cells ( Figure 3A ). Interestingly, there was often little difference in mRNA expression between control and NSC-34/hPGRN cells. We tested specifically for active growth cone formation using growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43, also called neuromodulin) ( Maier et al., 2013 ), and, for evidence of cholinergic differentiation using vesicular acetylcholine transporter (SLC18A3) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) as markers ( Figure 3B ). Expression of GAP-43, and SLC18A3 cells were unchanged between control and NSC-34/hPGRN cells but were decreased in NSC-34/shPGRN, further supporting a role for PGRN in supporting neuron-like structural differentiation in NSC-34 cells. In contrast ChAT mRNA levels, were unaffected by PGRN depletion. Increased expression of neurotrophic receptor transcripts in NSC-34/shPGRN cells was confirmed, with strong signals observed for NGFR (nerve growth factor receptor) and FZD3 (Frizzled 3, a wnt receptor) ( Figure 3C ). A concerted change in genes associated with lipid metabolism was confirmed ( Figure 3D ) with most genes downregulated in NSC-34/shPGRN cells compared to control or NSC-34/hPGRN cells as predicted. Not all lipid metabolism genes were downregulated, however, as mRNA for ceramide synthase 2 (CER2) was strongly upregulated.\n", "Neither IPA nor DAVID predicted a strong lysosomal response to PGRN depletion even though deletion of PGRN results in altered expression of lysosomal genes and proteins in other cell lines and  Grn  knockout mice ( Tanaka et al., 2017 ;  Huang et al., 2020 ). To evaluate whether PGRN depletion alters lysosome gene expression in NSC-34 cells we measured the relative mRNA levels of the lysosome proteins lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and cathepsin D (CTSD). There was no indication of increased expression of these genes in NSC-34/shPGRN cells ( Figure 3E ), and an apparent decrease in expression of cathepsin D, which implies a lack of extensive lysosome biogenesis upon partial PGRN depletion in this model.\n", "Lipid Groups Are Differentially Regulated in Progranulin Knockdown NSC-34 Cells\nSince the transcriptomic data suggested that lipid metabolic pathways are sensitive to PGRN depletion, we undertook mass spectrometric lipidomic analyses on NSC-34/shPGRN and NSC-34/hPGRN cells. Principal component analysis confirmed that all 3 replicates from the same cell construct segregate separately from the other constructs ( Supplementary Figure 4 ). High or low PGRN expression had no effect on the levels of the quantitatively dominant lipid groups ( Figure 4A ). In contrast, three lipid classes that are quantitatively less abundant, phosphatidic acid, ceramides and cholesteryl ester show upregulation of specific lipid members between high and low PGRN expressors ( Figures 4B-D ).\n", "Influence of Progranulin on Protein Expression\nThe influence of PGRN expression on cellular protein composition was determined comparing NSC-34/hPGRN, NSC-34/shPGRN cells, and control cells, respectively ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). The largest variability was detected between PGRN enriched NSC-34/hPGRN cells and NSC-34/shPGRN knockdown cells. Enrichment of GO and Kegg terms identified functional annotation clusters associated with cell adhesion, and metabolism ( Figures 5A,B ). Functional annotation clusters ( Figure 5C ) and enriched GO terms ( Figure 5D ) for proteins that were overexpressed in NSC-34/shPGRN cells were linked to cell adhesion, RNA binding, RNA processing and metabolism.\n", "Progranulin Binds to Multiple Membrane Proteins Both on the Cell Surface and in the Endoplasmic Reticulum/Golgi/Lysosome Network\nAs the observed PGRN-dependent phenotypes in NSC-34 cells are reproduced by extracellular PGRN ( Figures 1D,E ), implying an action on extracellular membrane proteins ( Chitramuthu et al., 2017a ;  Paushter et al., 2018 ), we therefore extended the proteomic analysis to probe specifically for potential PGRN membrane binding proteins using a LRC proteomic strategy ( Frei et al., 2012 ,  2013 ;  Figure 6A ). In total 1746 glycopeptides were identified and quantified. Of these, the cut-off criterion employed for inclusion as putative PGRN-binders was a log2 fold binding enrichment > 0.6 (which is equivalent to an approximately 1.5-fold change in absolute values), and a  p  value < 0.02 ( Supplementary Table 3 ). This yields 33 proteins. Most of the putative PGRN-binding proteins are associated with the plasma membrane, ER, or lysosome membranes ( Figure 6B ). Applying STRING analysis to this data set generated a potential interaction network of candidate lysosomal PGRN binding proteins that includes sortilin (SORT1, log2 fold enrichment 1.00 or 2 in natural numbers) and prosaposin (PSAP, log2 enrichment 0.716 or 1.64 in natural numbers) ( Figure 6C ). GO analysis of biological processes gave the highest score for lysosomal transport ( Figure 6D ). The presence of ER/Golgi/lysosome proteins is likely to be due to their exposure on the cell surface rather than uptake of labeled PGRN into the cells as the binding experiments were all conducted at 4\u00b0C. The highest scoring plasma membrane protein ( Supplementary Table 3 ) was the tetraspanin TSPAN4 (log2 fold enhancement 3.96 or 15.5-fold in natural numbers). A second tetraspanin, TSPAN31 (log2 fold enhancement 1.86 or 3.6-fold in natural numbers), was also captured. Two members of the RTK-family, RET (log2 fold enrichment 1.25 or 2.4-fold in natural numbers), which is the kinase subunit of the glial cell-derived nerve growth factor (GDNF) receptor, and PTK7 (protein tyrosine kinase 7, log2 fold enrichment 0.942875 or 1.92-fold in natural numbers), which is an inactive RTK homolog. In the insulin-binding control arm, multiple peptides for insulin (INSR) were identified (log2 fold enrichment 2.23 or 4.69 in natural values).\n", "Progranulin Increases Activity of Different Receptor Tyrosine Kinases in Different Cell Types\nReceptor phosphotyrosine antibody arrays were employed to screen for RTKs that are sensitive to PGRN expression levels ( Figure 7A ). RET, PDGFR-alpha (Platelet derived growth factor -alpha), Mer, and weakly, TrkA (high affinity nerve growth factor receptor), MusK (Muscle-Specific Kinase), and EphA3 (EPH Receptor A3) were more highly tyrosine phosphorylated in NSC-34/hPGRN cells than in vector controls or NSC-34/shPGRN knockdown cells ( Figure 7B ). Other reports, using the same phosphotyrosine receptor array screening technique, but analyzing non-neuronal cells, revealed that EphA2 was the likely RTK target for PGRN ( Neill et al., 2016 ). Given that EphA3 phosphorylation is only weakly enhanced by PGRN expression in NSC-343 cells, we tested PGRN in MDA-MD-468 mammary epithelial cells and detected phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and ErbB2 (an EGF-receptor family member), as well as members of the EphA family of receptors ( Figure 7A ). PGRN expression, therefore, activates different sets of tyrosine kinase receptors in different cell types implying cell context-dependent signaling. The antibody array results were validated by Western blot analyses using phospho-receptor specific antibodies ( Figures 7C,D ). RET expression is greatly reduced in NSC-34/shPGRN cells, suggesting that at least some of the differences observed in receptor RET tyrosine phosphorylation reflect differential expression of the RET protein, as was also predicted from the mRNA microarray analyses.\n"]}

MDA-MB-468 cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were grown in a 5% CO 2  incubator at 37\u00b0C. NSC-34 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) ( Cashman et al., 1992 ). MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. Stable transfectants that express human PGRN (NSC-34 and MDA-MB-468 cells), were generated by transfection with human PGRN (pcDNA3-hPGRN) or pcDNA3 for empty vector control transfections. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and selected with G418 (400 \u03bcg/ml) for 4-6 weeks according to manufacturer's instructions. To generate cells that stably express ShRNA-mPGRN, NSC-34 cells were transfected with shRNA constructs that were designed by OriGene Technologies using murine  Grn  specific 29 nucleotide stretches within the coding region. NSC-34 cells were seeded onto 6 well plates and then transfected with shRNA-mPGRN (pRS/shPGRN), or control vector (pRS vector alone, Origene Technologies), using Fugene (Roche) when the cultures were 80% confluent. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing in medium containing puromycin (7 \u03bcg/ml) (Invitrogen) for 6 weeks according to manufacturer's instructions. To prevent phenotypic drift, stocks of the original transfectants were frozen in liquid N 2  and reanimated at regular intervals.\nReverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis\nTotal RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed with Revert-aid reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific). Human and mouse PGRN specific primer sets were designed to amplify species specific products. See  Supplementary Table 1  for the sequences of the PCR primers. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) program consisted of denaturation for 2 min at 94\u00b0C; 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C, 30 s; 55\u00b0C, 30 s; 72\u00b0C, 30 s; and a final extension of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (Bio-Basic).\nWestern Blot Analysis\nRadioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma) mixed with Complete Protease inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, 1 tablet for 7 ml buffer) was used to lyse and extract proteins from NSC-34 cells. Protein lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min, briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were quantified for protein content and equal amounts were mixed with 2\u00d7 sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins on the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked over-night with membrane blocking agent (GE Healthcare) or non-fat milk (Thermo Scientific) at 4\u00b0C. The blots were incubated with 1:250 anti-human PGRN polyclonal antibody (rabbit anti-human PGRN generated in our laboratory) or 1:10000 anti-human PGRN (R&D system) for 1 h in blocking buffer followed by extensive washing. After incubating with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:4,000) at room temperature for 1 h and blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Other antibodies used were 1:1000 anti-Ret (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-phospho Ret (abcam), 1:2000 anti-EGFR, anti-phosphoEGFR, anti-ErbB2, anti-phosphoErbB2 (R&D systems). Protein loading controls were performed by stripping the membrane and probing with mouse monoclonal beta-actin antibody (AC-40; Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000.\nMorphometric Analysis\nCells were plated in 6 well plates at 7000 cells per well containing DMEM with 10% FBS. After 24 h, the media was replaced with DMEM containing 0% FBS, 1% FBS, or 10% FBS. The cultures were monitored for 25 days, and photographs were acquired using an inverted phase contrast microscope. The photographs were analyzed using ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2012 ) by enabling the \"Area\" and \"Shape\" descriptors, and \"Perimeter\" and \"Feret's diameter\" measurements ( Rasband, 1977 ). Feret's diameteris the longest distance between any two points along the selection boundary ( Ferreira and Rasband, 2012 ), sometimes also called the \"caliper length,\" and is a measure of asymmetry. The neurite-like projections were measured using the NeuronJ plugin. 1  This facilitates the tracing and quantification of neurite extension using the software ImageJ ( Meijering et al., 2004 ;  Meijering, 2010 ).\nNeurite Extension Assay\nCells were cultured in 12 well plates coated with nitrocellulose which was prepared by dissolving 5 cm 2  of nitrocellulose (membrane 0.22 um, Bio basic) in 6 ml of methanol. Briefly 0.1 ml aliquots of this solution were rapidly spread over the surface of each well in 12 well plate and allowed to dry under a laminar flow hood as described in  Lagenaur and Lemmon (1987) . PGRN was applied in 3 \u03bcl droplets containing 100 \u03bcg/ml. After one minute, the droplets were removed gently using a pipette. The plates were then blocked by washing twice with 2 ml of culture media (DMEM with 10% FBS) for 10 min each. NSC- 34 cells were cultured on the nitrocellulose coated plates at the concentration of 6000 cells per ml in 2 ml medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 days. The neurite length was measured using ImageJ by tracing the neurite-like projections.\nStatistics for Neurite Extension and Morphometric Analyses\nStatistical significance among experimental groups was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's Multiple Comparisons Test ( p  < 0.001- *** ,  p  < 0.01- ** ,  p  < 0.05-*) using GraphPad software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Error bars represent s.e.m.\nTranscriptomics Analysis\nNSC-34/shPGRN, NSC-34/hPGRN, or control constructs were cultured in T75 flasks. They were sub-cultured in four replicates. NSC-34 cells (200,000) from each of 12 flasks were plated in T25 flasks with serum. After 24 h the media containing 10% serum was removed and replaced with media containing 5% serum. After a further 24 h the media was changed to one containing 1% serum. 24 h later cells were lysed in Trizol and total RNA was extracted. The RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop chip. cDNA synthesis was carried out using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Scientific). Following cDNA synthesis reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to confirm over/under expression of PGRN as indicated earlier. Reduced levels of mPGRN were noticed in all shPGRN constructs and expression of hPGRN was detected only in the over-expressors as expected. The over/under expression of PGRN levels were further confirmed by Western blot as mentioned previously.\nThe RNA quality/integrity was analyzed using a Nano ChiP Bioanalyzer. The gene expression profile was determined using Illumina Mouse Whole-Genome Expression BeadChips (MouseWG-6 v2.0, multiple 12 samples) at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. The data replicates were validated by principal component analysis which confirmed that all 4 replicates from the same construct segregate together and separately from the other constructs. The lumi normalization followed by an empirical Bayesian, EB ( Wright and Simon, 2003 ) algorithm was applied to the data using FlexArray 1.6.1 software (available at  http://gqinnovationcenter.com/services/bioinformatics/flexarray/tutorials.aspx?l=e ) to identify genes that were either significantly reduced or induced in the PGRN over/under expressing NSC-34 cells compared to controls. The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8 ( Huang da et al., 2009b , a ) was employed to provide tables of enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and predicted functional pathways based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Gene networks were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway analysis software (IPA). IPA is a web-based bioinformatics application that allows data analysis from microarray experiments by identifying related proteins within a pathway. 1.5-fold enrichment or depletion of transcript signal was used as the cut-off ( Kramer et al., 2014 ). Additional functional assignments for individual genes were obtained manually by searching for their entries in Uniprot, 2  Genecards 3  and On-line Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM 4 ). Gene expression data was submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository, accession number:  GSE185877 .\nLipidomic Analysis\nLipidomics and Proteomics mass spectrometric analyses were performed by the Proteomics Technology Platform, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal (manager Lorne Taylor). NSC-34/shPGRN or NSC-34/hPGRN cells were cultured in T75 flasks in DMEM with 1% FBS. Cells were collected by trypsinization at about 70% confluency. Three independent extractions and mass spectrometric analyses were performed. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml and cell numbers were determined. Twenty million cells from each sample were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min and incubated with 150 \u03bcl methanol and 500 \u03bcl Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, Fisher Scientific) for 2 h on a rocker at room temperature. Phase-separation was performed by adding 125 \u03bcl of MS grade water (Fisher Scientific). After 10 min incubation at room temperature each sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The upper organic phase was collected, and the lower phase was re-extracted by adding methanol, MTBE, and water. Both fractions were combined, dried using a SpeedVac lyophilizer and were introduced into the TripleTOF\u2122 5600 System by direct infusion using the Nanospray III source and an Eksigent NanoLC Ultra and Autosampler at a flow rate of 1 \u03bcL/min. The data were analyzed using peak view Software and lipid identification and quantification was done in lipid view Software.\nProteomics Analysis\nNSC-34/ShPGRN, NSC-34-/hPGRN, or vector controls were cultured in T75 flasks in DMEM with 1% FBS until about 80% confluency. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed by homogenizing in solution containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 nM NaCl, and 0.320M sucrose. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Samples were normalized for input by cell numbers and subsequently by total peptides using the Scaffold program (see below) at the data analysis stage. For each sample, proteins were loaded onto a single stacking gel band to remove lipids, detergents and salts. The gel band was reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetic acid and digested with trypsin. Extracted peptides were re-solubilized in 0.1% aqueous formic acid and loaded onto a Thermo Acclaim Pepmap (Thermo, 75 uM ID \u00d7 2 cm C18 3 uM beads) precolumn and then onto an Acclaim Pepmap Easyspray (Thermo, 75 uM \u00d7 15 cm with 2 uM C18 beads) analytical column separation using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 uHPLC at 230 nl/min with a gradient of 2-35% organic (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 3 h. Peptides were analyzed using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer operating at 120,000 resolution (FWHM in MS1) with HCD sequencing (15,000 resolution) at top speed for all peptides with a charge of 2+or greater. The raw data were converted into *.mgf format (Mascot generic format) for searching using the Mascot 2.6.2 search engine (Matrix Science) against mouse protein sequences (Uniprot 2018). The database search results were loaded onto Scaffold Q+ Scaffold_4.8.9 (Proteome Sciences) for statistical treatment and data visualization. Proteomics data was submitted to MassIVE public repository by participating in ProteomeXchange, accession number:  MSV000088451 . The Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8 ( Huang da et al., 2009b , a ) was employed to analyze Gene Ontology (GO) as above using a 1.2-fold change cut-off and  p  < 0.05.\nMembrane Protein Interactomics of Progranulin by Ligand Receptor Capture\nLigand receptor capture (LRC) identifies the interactions of extracellular soluble proteins with membrane proteins in live cells by making use of a biotinylated trifunctional reagent TRICEPS ( Frei et al., 2012 ). All reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. 300 \u03bcg PGRN (R&D Systems), or insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) as the positive control, were coupled to 1.5 \u03bcl TRICEPS by an amide linkage. The second functional group of the TRICEPS reagent, a protected hydrazine, reacts with aldehydes on the glycan side chains of the target receptor proteins. As aldehydes are not typically present on the cell surface, they are first generated by mild sodium metaperiodate oxidation using 6 \u00d7 10 8  NSC-34 cells. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and washed once with 1\u00d7 PBS then in DMEM without serum for 30 min prior to cells collection. The LRC reaction was initiated by incubating mildly oxidized and washed living cells with 50 \u03bcl of the PGRN-TRICEPS conjugate, or 50 \u03bcl of Insulin-TRICEPS for 90 min at 4\u00b0C during which time PGRN-TRICEPS or insulin-TRICEPS reacts covalently through hydrazine coupling to the glycan chains of any cell surface membrane protein to which it binds. The cells were lysed, digested with trypsin and the TRICEPS labeled peptides recovered by biotin affinity using streptavidin beads. For mass spectrometry the streptavidin-purified peptides were de-glycosylated using PNGaseF, an enzyme which cuts between the proximal  N -acetylglucosamine of the glycan side chain and the glycopeptide asparagine in the N-X-S/T glycosylation site motif (N stands for asparagine, X is any amino acid except proline and S/T is serine or threonine). The PNGase reaction deamidates the asparagine and modifies the N-X-S/T glycosylation motif to a D-X-S/T motif (where D is aspartic acid), the corresponding mass shift being used to identify peptides that were crosslinked by the PGRN or Insulin-TRICEPS conjugates. The TRICEPS labeled peptide recovery and the mass spectrometric analyses were performed by DualSystems Biotech. The samples were analyzed on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer. Peptide identifications were filtered to a false-discovery rate of \u22641% and quantified using an MS1-based label-free approach. For the MS1 quantification, the non-linear DYNAMICS Progenesis QI for proteomics was used. The experiment was done in triplicate. All six samples, PGRN and insulin control, showed an alignment score of >90%. Therefore, none of the six samples had to be excluded from statistical analysis. The Data is presented as a volcano plot where all the membrane proteins that crosslinked to either PGRN or the insulin control fall as statistical outliers on either arm of the plot. Positive detection of the insulin receptor control signal confirms that the TRICEPs reaction worked under the conditions used, and that there was no protein denaturation. Non-specific binding is accounted for as signals that are statistically indistinguishable between the insulin and progranulin arms of the experiment. Possible interactions among proteins identified in these assays was performed using the STRING program (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 ).\nPhospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Antibody Array\nThe proteome profiler mouse or human Phospho-Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTK) antibody array membranes (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were incubated with NSC-34 or MDA-MB-468 cell lysates and processed as per the manufacturer's protocol using a Phosphotyrosine specific antibody. In brief, approximately 3 \u00d7 10 7  cells of NSC-34/shPGRN cells expressing reduced PGRN, NSC-34/hPGRN cells overexpressing PGRN and WT NSC-34 control, MDA-MB-468 WT and PGRN expressing cells were cultured in serum free medium overnight. After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and lysed with lysis buffer containing aprotonin/leupeptin (10 \u03bcg/mL each) for 30 min, centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and stored at -80 degrees A protein assay (BioRad Biotechnologies, Hercules, CA) was performed before incubating with the RTK membranes to normalize loadings.\n"], "ner": [[[565, 569, "GENE"], [579, 583, "GENE"], [827, 831, "GENE"], [1083, 1087, "GENE"]], [[1726, 1730, "GENE"]], [[2831, 2835, "GENE"], [2875, 2879, "GENE"], [2931, 2935, "GENE"], [3327, 3330, "GENE"], [3376, 3379, "GENE"], [3401, 3405, "GENE"], [3419, 3423, "GENE"], [3430, 3435, "GENE"], [3449, 3454, "GENE"], [3570, 3580, "GENE"]], [], [[4941, 4945, "GENE"]], [], [[5792, 5796, "GENE"], [5806, 5810, "GENE"], [6560, 6564, "GENE"], [6606, 6610, "GENE"], [6633, 6637, "GENE"], [6668, 6672, "GENE"], [6756, 6760, "GENE"]], [[7618, 7622, "GENE"]], [[8834, 8838, "GENE"], [8850, 8854, "GENE"]], [[10050, 10054, "GENE"], [10065, 10069, "GENE"]], [[12387, 12391, "GENE"], [12410, 12417, "GENE"], [13062, 13066, "GENE"], [13150, 13154, "GENE"], [14012, 14016, "GENE"], [14501, 14505, "GENE"], [14510, 14517, "GENE"], [14742, 14746, "GENE"], [14852, 14868, "GENE"], [15099, 15106, "GENE"], [15111, 15122, "GENE"]], [[15721, 15725, "GENE"], [15751, 15755, "GENE"], [15791, 15795, "GENE"], [15837, 15841, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], "sentences": ["\nCell Culture, Transfection, and Validation\nNSC-34 cells were used as previously described ( Ryan et al., 2009 ) and were the gift of Dr. Heather Durham, (Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, QC). MDA-MB-468 cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were grown in a 5% CO 2  incubator at 37\u00b0C. NSC-34 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) ( Cashman et al., 1992 ). MDA-MB-468 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. Stable transfectants that express human PGRN (NSC-34 and MDA-MB-468 cells), were generated by transfection with human PGRN (pcDNA3-hPGRN) or pcDNA3 for empty vector control transfections. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and selected with G418 (400 \u03bcg/ml) for 4-6 weeks according to manufacturer's instructions. To generate cells that stably express ShRNA-mPGRN, NSC-34 cells were transfected with shRNA constructs that were designed by OriGene Technologies using murine  Grn  specific 29 nucleotide stretches within the coding region. NSC-34 cells were seeded onto 6 well plates and then transfected with shRNA-mPGRN (pRS/shPGRN), or control vector (pRS vector alone, Origene Technologies), using Fugene (Roche) when the cultures were 80% confluent. Stable transfectants were selected by culturing in medium containing puromycin (7 \u03bcg/ml) (Invitrogen) for 6 weeks according to manufacturer's instructions. To prevent phenotypic drift, stocks of the original transfectants were frozen in liquid N 2  and reanimated at regular intervals.\n", "Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis\nTotal RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed with Revert-aid reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific). Human and mouse PGRN specific primer sets were designed to amplify species specific products. See  Supplementary Table 1  for the sequences of the PCR primers. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) program consisted of denaturation for 2 min at 94\u00b0C; 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C, 30 s; 55\u00b0C, 30 s; 72\u00b0C, 30 s; and a final extension of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR was performed using Taq DNA Polymerase (Bio-Basic).\n", "Western Blot Analysis\nRadioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Sigma) mixed with Complete Protease inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science, 1 tablet for 7 ml buffer) was used to lyse and extract proteins from NSC-34 cells. Protein lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min, briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were quantified for protein content and equal amounts were mixed with 2\u00d7 sample buffer, boiled for 5 min and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins on the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked over-night with membrane blocking agent (GE Healthcare) or non-fat milk (Thermo Scientific) at 4\u00b0C. The blots were incubated with 1:250 anti-human PGRN polyclonal antibody (rabbit anti-human PGRN generated in our laboratory) or 1:10000 anti-human PGRN (R&D system) for 1 h in blocking buffer followed by extensive washing. After incubating with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:4,000) at room temperature for 1 h and blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Other antibodies used were 1:1000 anti-Ret (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-phospho Ret (abcam), 1:2000 anti-EGFR, anti-phosphoEGFR, anti-ErbB2, anti-phosphoErbB2 (R&D systems). Protein loading controls were performed by stripping the membrane and probing with mouse monoclonal beta-actin antibody (AC-40; Sigma) at a dilution of 1:1000.\n", "Morphometric Analysis\nCells were plated in 6 well plates at 7000 cells per well containing DMEM with 10% FBS. After 24 h, the media was replaced with DMEM containing 0% FBS, 1% FBS, or 10% FBS. The cultures were monitored for 25 days, and photographs were acquired using an inverted phase contrast microscope. The photographs were analyzed using ImageJ ( Schindelin et al., 2012 ) by enabling the \"Area\" and \"Shape\" descriptors, and \"Perimeter\" and \"Feret's diameter\" measurements ( Rasband, 1977 ). Feret's diameteris the longest distance between any two points along the selection boundary ( Ferreira and Rasband, 2012 ), sometimes also called the \"caliper length,\" and is a measure of asymmetry. The neurite-like projections were measured using the NeuronJ plugin. 1  This facilitates the tracing and quantification of neurite extension using the software ImageJ ( Meijering et al., 2004 ;  Meijering, 2010 ).\n", "Neurite Extension Assay\nCells were cultured in 12 well plates coated with nitrocellulose which was prepared by dissolving 5 cm 2  of nitrocellulose (membrane 0.22 um, Bio basic) in 6 ml of methanol. Briefly 0.1 ml aliquots of this solution were rapidly spread over the surface of each well in 12 well plate and allowed to dry under a laminar flow hood as described in  Lagenaur and Lemmon (1987) . PGRN was applied in 3 \u03bcl droplets containing 100 \u03bcg/ml. After one minute, the droplets were removed gently using a pipette. The plates were then blocked by washing twice with 2 ml of culture media (DMEM with 10% FBS) for 10 min each. NSC- 34 cells were cultured on the nitrocellulose coated plates at the concentration of 6000 cells per ml in 2 ml medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 days. The neurite length was measured using ImageJ by tracing the neurite-like projections.\n", "Statistics for Neurite Extension and Morphometric Analyses\nStatistical significance among experimental groups was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's Multiple Comparisons Test ( p  < 0.001- *** ,  p  < 0.01- ** ,  p  < 0.05-*) using GraphPad software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA).

NSC-34 cells (200,000) from each of 12 flasks were plated in T25 flasks with serum. After 24 h the media containing 10% serum was removed and replaced with media containing 5% serum. After a further 24 h the media was changed to one containing 1% serum. 24 h later cells were lysed in Trizol and total RNA was extracted. The RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop chip. cDNA synthesis was carried out using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Scientific). Following cDNA synthesis reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to confirm over/under expression of PGRN as indicated earlier. Reduced levels of mPGRN were noticed in all shPGRN constructs and expression of hPGRN was detected only in the over-expressors as expected. The over/under expression of PGRN levels were further confirmed by Western blot as mentioned previously.\n", "The RNA quality/integrity was analyzed using a Nano ChiP Bioanalyzer. The gene expression profile was determined using Illumina Mouse Whole-Genome Expression BeadChips (MouseWG-6 v2.0, multiple 12 samples) at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. The data replicates were validated by principal component analysis which confirmed that all 4 replicates from the same construct segregate together and separately from the other constructs. The lumi normalization followed by an empirical Bayesian, EB ( Wright and Simon, 2003 ) algorithm was applied to the data using FlexArray 1.6.1 software (available at  http://gqinnovationcenter.com/services/bioinformatics/flexarray/tutorials.aspx?l=e ) to identify genes that were either significantly reduced or induced in the PGRN over/under expressing NSC-34 cells compared to controls.

{"doc_key": "8791029_Introduction", "text": ["\nNeurodegenerative diseases of aging are a leading cause of death, disability, and dependency ( Erkkinen et al., 2018 ). The importance of progranulin (PGRN) in maintaining the health of the aging brain is well established ( Chitramuthu et al., 2017a ). For example, a genome-wide association study identified  GRN  (the gene for PGRN) as the second most prominent locus conferring resilience against age-related deterioration of the cerebral cortex ( Rhinn and Abeliovich, 2017 ). Clinically, heterozygous non-sense mutations of  GRN  that result in a loss of 50% of PGRN mRNA, cause FTD-GRN, a form of frontotemporal dementia that results from a progressive cortical atrophy and is, at present, almost always lethal ( Baker et al., 2006 ;  Cruts et al., 2006 ). FTD-GRN is a TDP-43 proteinopathy, that is, it is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular inclusions of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TAR DNA-binding protein 43 or TDP-43). Other important TDP-43 proteinopathies include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ( Neumann et al., 2006 ), limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy ( Nelson et al., 2019 ), and traumatic encephalopathy ( McKee et al., 2010 ). Missense mutations of  GRN  have been identified in diseases other than FTD, including ALS ( Schymick et al., 2007 ;  Sleegers et al., 2008 ;  Cannon et al., 2013 ) and Alzheimer's Disease ( Brouwers et al., 2008 ), although these are rare. Moreover, some variants of the  GRN  gene act as modifiers of ALS progression, reducing the age of onset of the disease and shortening survival ( Sleegers et al., 2008 ). Occasionally both alleles of  GRN  are mutated, leading to the complete loss of PGRN mRNA and resulting in a lysosomal storage disorder called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) ( Smith et al., 2012 ). GRN-related NCL is clinically distinct from FTD, but it is highly likely that milder defects in autophagy and lysosome function contribute to FTD-GRN pathology ( Gotzl et al., 2014 ). The role of  GRN -deficiency in FTD has prompted interest in the development of PGRN-based therapies by, for example, increasing PGRN levels in the brain ( Arrant et al., 2017 ,  2018 ;  Miyakawa et al., 2020 ), or promoting read-through of  GRN  non-sense mutations ( Frew et al., 2020 ;  Kuang et al., 2020 ).\nJust as loss of PGRN is detrimental to brain health, enhanced expression of PGRN in the central nervous system (CNS) protected against the onset of several pathological phenotypes, at least in experimental models ( Chitramuthu et al., 2017a ). Thus, in mice, increased PGRN expression improved the NCL-like phenotype of PGRN knockout mice ( Arrant et al., 2018 ), inhibited the onset of disease-like phenotypes in TDP-43-related ALS ( Beel et al., 2018 ), as well as pathologies that are not related to TDP-43, such as genetic models of Alzheimer's disease ( Minami et al., 2014 ;  Van Kampen and Kay, 2017 ), and chemically induced Parkinson's disease ( Van Kampen et al., 2014 ). In addition to a protective action in chronic neurodegenerative conditions, PGRN stimulated neuronal regeneration and reinnervation following acute peripheral nerve injury ( Altmann et al., 2016 ) and exerted a protective action during acute cerebral ischemia ( Kanazawa et al., 2015 ,  2019 ). Clearly, therefore, PGRN exerts a remarkably broad spectrum of protection across proteinopathy boundaries and in both chronic neurodegenerative diseases and acute neuronal injury.\nProgranulin has multiple biological actions. It is neurotrophic ( Van Damme et al., 2008 ;  Ryan et al., 2009 ), it down-regulates microglial neuroinflammation ( Martens et al., 2012 ), and it influences both lysosomal activity ( Kao et al., 2017 ;  Paushter et al., 2018 ;  Elia et al., 2019 ) and autophagy ( Chang et al., 2017 ;  Elia et al., 2019 ;  Doyle et al., 2021 ). Understanding how PGRN affects neuronal biology will provide insights into brain aging and resilience against neurodegeneration. Here we sought to employ a simple, readily accessible, cellular model to investigate how PGRN expression influences structural and molecular phenotypes. We have shown previously that cultures of the neuron-like cell line, NSC-34 modified to over-express PGRN, remained alive and in a differentiated state for at least 90 days in the complete absence of serum, whereas under the same serum-free conditions unmodified NSC-34 cells died within less than 10 days ( Ryan et al., 2009 ). The ability of PGRN to support the survival of NSC-34 cells for months in the absence of any exogenous trophic support suggests that these cells are highly responsive to PGRN and may be a useful  in vitro  model for investigating cellular, molecular and biochemical aspects of PGRN action. NSC-34 cells were derived by the fusion of primary embryonic motor neurons with a neuroblastoma cell line ( Cashman et al., 1992 ), and display many physiological properties of motor neurons, including the expression of neurofilament proteins, generation of action potentials, storage and release of acetylcholine, and induction of myotubular clustering of acetylcholine receptors ( Cashman et al., 1992 ;  Durham et al., 1993 ;  Maier et al., 2013 ). They have, in addition, been widely used to study ALS-like TDP-43 neurotoxicity ( Yang et al., 2010 ;  Colombrita et al., 2012 ;  Lu et al., 2012 ;  Smethurst et al., 2016 ;  Moujalled et al., 2017 ;  Tian et al., 2017 ;  Chen T. et al., 2018 ;  Maurel et al., 2018 ;  Salvatori et al., 2018 ;  Hicks et al., 2020 ). PGRN is intimately involved in motor neuron function. In a semi-quantitative assessment motor neurons in the brain (pontine gray matter) and the spinal cord displayed the highest neuronal PGRN expression ( Ryan et al., 2009 ) and PGRN is neurotrophic for motor neurons in primary tissue culture ( Van Damme et al., 2008 ). In zebrafish, PGRN modulates the outgrowth and branching of primary motor neurons ( Chitramuthu et al., 2010 ) and protects them from axonopathy caused by genes associated with motor neuron diseases including TDP-43 ( Laird et al., 2010 ;  Chitramuthu et al., 2017b ), FUS (fused in sarcoma) ( Chitramuthu et al., 2017b ) and SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1) ( Chitramuthu et al., 2010 ). It significantly delays the onset of TDP-43-dependent ALS-like phenotypes in mice ( Beel et al., 2018 ). Here we have undertaken a series of parallel molecular analyses to identify how PGRN expression, or its depletion, affects the properties of NSC-34 motor neuron-like cells. The effect of PGRN insufficiency on the transcriptome of FTD-GRN brains has been reported at autopsy ( Chen-Plotkin et al., 2008 ), or in Grn-/- mice ( Chang et al., 2017 ). These analyzes, however, reflect late-stage events beyond the window of potential therapeutic intervention, and occur in a complex cellular environment where it is often difficult to assign observed effects to specific cells. Distinguishing effects that are the result of PGRN depletion itself from those that are secondary responses in reaction to the damage caused by PGRN depletion is not always clear. Moreover, the pathology of brains from Grn-/- mice differs from that of human FTD-GRN, and appears closer to NCL ( Ahmed et al., 2010 ), while GRN+/- mice, that genocopy human FTD-GRN, show only mild phenotypes that are not fully representative of the human disease ( Filiano et al., 2013 ). Cell-autonomous transcriptional analyses of PGRN insufficiency phenotypes have been performed using shRNA to diminish PGRN expression in primary human neural stem cells, where several pathways were affected ( Rosen et al., 2011 ), whereas no transcriptional effect of GRN depletion was observed in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons with GRN expression reduced by siRNA ( Robin et al., 2020 ). The NSC-34 model allows the analysis of both PGRN insufficiency and elevated PGRN expression in a neuron-related cell that is highly dependent on intrinsic PGRN expression for survival and the maintenance of its neuronal phenotype.\n"], "ner": [[[139, 150, "GENE"], [152, 156, "GENE"], [311, 314, "GENE"], [330, 334, "GENE"], [531, 534, "GENE"], [568, 572, "GENE"], [589, 592, "GENE"], [604, 627, "DISEASE"], [764, 767, "DISEASE"], [768, 771, "GENE"], [1071, 1100, "DISEASE"], [1102, 1105, "DISEASE"], [1287, 1290, "GENE"], [1336, 1339, "DISEASE"], [1351, 1354, "DISEASE"], [1433, 1452, "DISEASE"], [1537, 1540, "GENE"], [1567, 1570, "DISEASE"], [1706, 1709, "GENE"], [1756, 1760, "GENE"], [1819, 1849, "DISEASE"], [1851, 1854, "DISEASE"], [1880, 1883, "GENE"], [1892, 1895, "DISEASE"], [1924, 1927, "DISEASE"], [2022, 2025, "DISEASE"], [2026, 2029, "GENE"], [2077, 2080, "GENE"], [2096, 2099, "DISEASE"], [2144, 2148, "GENE"], [2193, 2197, "GENE"], [2306, 2309, "GENE"]], [[2392, 2396, "GENE"], [2452, 2456, "GENE"], [2645, 2649, "GENE"], [2696, 2700, "GENE"], [2805, 2808, "DISEASE"], [2913, 2932, "DISEASE"], [3009, 3028, "DISEASE"], [3134, 3138, "GENE"], [3309, 3317, "DISEASE"], [3373, 3377, "GENE"], [3479, 3504, "DISEASE"]], [[3533, 3544, "GENE"]], [[3927, 3931, "GENE"]], [[4127, 4131, "GENE"]], [[4292, 4296, "GENE"], [4535, 4539, "GENE"], [4690, 4694, "GENE"], [4797, 4801, "GENE"], [4892, 4905, "DISEASE"], [5312, 5315, "DISEASE"], [5579, 5583, "GENE"], [5767, 5771, "GENE"], [5809, 5813, "GENE"], [5916, 5920, "GENE"], [6079, 6099, "DISEASE"], [6111, 6117, "GENE"], [6171, 6174, "GENE"], [6176, 6192, "GENE"], [6228, 6232, "GENE"], [6234, 6257, "GENE"], [6343, 6346, "GENE"], [6474, 6478, "GENE"], [6581, 6585, "GENE"], [6624, 6627, "DISEASE"], [6628, 6631, "GENE"], [6705, 6708, "GENE"], [7013, 7017, "GENE"], [7111, 7115, "GENE"], [7186, 7189, "GENE"], [7225, 7228, "DISEASE"], [7229, 7232, "GENE"], [7290, 7293, "GENE"], [7323, 7326, "DISEASE"], [7327, 7330, "GENE"], [7483, 7487, "GENE"], [7557, 7561, "GENE"], [7707, 7710, "GENE"], [7795, 7798, "GENE"], [7896, 7900, "GENE"], [7928, 7932, "GENE"], [8007, 8011, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "sentences": ["\nNeurodegenerative diseases of aging are a leading cause of death, disability, and dependency ( Erkkinen et al., 2018 ). The importance of progranulin (PGRN) in maintaining the health of the aging brain is well established ( Chitramuthu et al., 2017a ). For example, a genome-wide association study identified  GRN  (the gene for PGRN) as the second most prominent locus conferring resilience against age-related deterioration of the cerebral cortex ( Rhinn and Abeliovich, 2017 ). Clinically, heterozygous non-sense mutations of  GRN  that result in a loss of 50% of PGRN mRNA, cause FTD-GRN, a form of frontotemporal dementia that results from a progressive cortical atrophy and is, at present, almost always lethal ( Baker et al., 2006 ;  Cruts et al., 2006 ). FTD-GRN is a TDP-43 proteinopathy, that is, it is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular inclusions of ubiquitinated and phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TAR DNA-binding protein 43 or TDP-43). Other important TDP-43 proteinopathies include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) ( Neumann et al., 2006 ), limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy ( Nelson et al., 2019 ), and traumatic encephalopathy ( McKee et al., 2010 ). Missense mutations of  GRN  have been identified in diseases other than FTD, including ALS ( Schymick et al., 2007 ;  Sleegers et al., 2008 ;  Cannon et al., 2013 ) and Alzheimer's Disease ( Brouwers et al., 2008 ), although these are rare. Moreover, some variants of the  GRN  gene act as modifiers of ALS progression, reducing the age of onset of the disease and shortening survival ( Sleegers et al., 2008 ). Occasionally both alleles of  GRN  are mutated, leading to the complete loss of PGRN mRNA and resulting in a lysosomal storage disorder called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) ( Smith et al., 2012 ). GRN-related NCL is clinically distinct from FTD, but it is highly likely that milder defects in autophagy and lysosome function contribute to FTD-GRN pathology ( Gotzl et al., 2014 ).

{"doc_key": "8791029_Discussion", "text": ["\nMotor neurons express PGRN at very high levels ( Ryan et al., 2009 ) and are distinguished by the size of their cell bodies and the length of their axons. Based on results for NSC-34, PGRN may contribute to maintaining their morphology, as high PGRN expression clearly led to cell body enlargement and promoted axon extension, whereas PGRN depleted cells were unable to enlarge, and extensions were often unusually branched and poorly condensed. This, together with the previously reported dependency of NSC-34 cells upon PGRN for survival in the absence of trophic support from serum ( Ryan et al., 2009 ), implies a marked trophic effect for PGRN on NSC-34 cells.\nThe morphological response to PGRN expression correlated well with molecular phenotypes that included mRNA pathways associated with the regulation of the cytoskeleton. This was further supported by changes in cell adhesion pathways in the proteome of NSC-34/hPGRN and NSC-34/shPGRN cells. PGRN depletion also impacted pathways associated with synaptic structure and function with presynaptic pathways particularly sensitive to PGRN depletion. These observations in NSC-34 cells are consistent with  in vivo  observations, where PGRN exerts complex roles in maintaining synaptic structure and connections ( Tapia et al., 2011 ;  Petkau et al., 2012 ;  Petoukhov et al., 2013 ;  Uesaka et al., 2018 ). Importantly, synaptic defects precede the onset of overt neuropathology in  Grn  knockout mice ( Petkau et al., 2012 ), but it is unclear how PGRN influences synaptic structure. Synaptic pruning by microglia ( Lui et al., 2016 ), and sortilin-mediated PGRN synaptic strengthening between climbing fibers and Purkinje cells during development ( Uesaka et al., 2018 ), have been reported. The results from NSC-34 cells suggest that additional cell-autonomous mechanisms may also be involved.\nProgranulin depletion in NSC-34 cells altered the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, although there was no global change in the levels of the quantitatively dominant lipid classes such as di- and triacyl glycerides and phosphatidylserines. Alterations in these lipid classes have, however, been observed in  Grn-/-  and  Grn +/- mouse brains, probably as the result of lysosomal abnormalities ( Evers et al., 2017 ). In contrast, lipids in the less abundant cholesterol ester, ceramide and phosphatidic acid families were elevated in PGRN-depleted NSC-34 cells. Increased ceramide expression is possibly due, in part, to increased CER2 (ceramide synthase 2) expression. There is increasing evidence, however, that PGRN intervenes at several key points in ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism. It modulates the activity of at least two enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism, glucocerebrosidase (GBA) ( Jian et al., 2016a , b ;  Arrant et al., 2019 ;  Valdez et al., 2020 ), and hexosaminidase A ( Chen Y. et al., 2018 ). In addition, it binds to prosaposin, and regulates its trafficking and processing to saponins ( Zhou et al., 2017 ;  Valdez et al., 2020 ) which are non-enzymatic lysosomal proteins that promote sphingolipid catabolism. Ceramides play important roles in neurodegeneration ( Cutler et al., 2004 ), and it will be important to determine to what extent they may contribute to the survival and morphological defects of NSC-34/shPGRN cells.\nAlthough PGRN exercises a strong cell autonomous trophic action in NSC-34 cells, it remains unclear how this is exerted. Since extracellular PGRN replicated these actions, binding to membrane proteins is probably required, and we chose, therefore, to further investigate the properties of PGRN binding to NSC-34 cell membrane proteins. Several putative PGRN receptors and binding proteins have been proposed. Among them are heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( Gonzalez et al., 2003 ;  Yip et al., 2014 ), EphA2 ( Neill et al., 2016 ), Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 ( Tang et al., 2011 ), Toll-like receptor-9 ( Park et al., 2011 ), notch receptors ( Altmann et al., 2016 ), components of lysosomal trafficking such as sortilin ( Hu et al., 2010 ) and prosaposin ( Zhou et al., 2015 ), and lysosomal enzymes involved in lipid and protein metabolism ( Paushter et al., 2018 ). Reconciling these diverse binding proteins into an integrated model of PGRN action is challenging, particularly since PGRN may interact with more than one membrane protein at the same time. We employed LRC, a membrane interactomic strategy to obtain an unbiased survey of membrane-bound PGRN binding proteins in live NSC-34 cells, and thereby probe the nature and range of PGRN binding to membrane proteins. PGRN captured multiple membrane proteins ( Figure 6  and  Supplementary Table 3 ), of which several (12 of 33) have equal or stronger enrichment for PGRN binding than the classic receptor ligand insulin had for its receptor, although with lower  p  values. GNPTA (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunits alpha/beta), for example, has a log2 fold enrichment of 8.31 (or 317 in natural numbers), compared to a log2 fold enrichment of 2.23 for the insulin receptor. The lower  p  values in the PGRN versus the insulin arm are probably due to the capture of fewer unique peptides per protein than for the insulin receptor. Although some captured proteins may be false positives, the strong enrichment of PGRN binding to its putative partners, often greater than that of insulin for its receptor, together with the identification of established PGRN proteins such as sortilin, and the limited number of proteins in the PGRN capture set (33) versus the set of all glycoproteins identified (1746), suggests that the observed multiplicity of binding is an authentic reflection of how PGRN interacts with NSC-34 cells. The multiplicity of binding partners in the same cell type is consistent with reports, noted above, of multiple putative PGRN binding proteins, and suggests that PGRN may act on complexes or networks of binding proteins, rather than single dedicated receptors, as has, indeed been found for its interaction with lysosomal proteins ( Paushter et al., 2018 ;  Cui et al., 2019 ).\nMost predicted PGRN membrane-protein partners in NSC-34 cells were located either within the plasma membrane (19/33 proteins) or the ER/Golgi/lysosome compartments (12 proteins). The enrichment of GO terms for lysosomal transport in predicted protein interaction networks supports the role of PGRN in lysosomal functions. Interestingly, however, neither the transcriptomic nor proteomic analyses detected a consistent effect of PGRN depletion on lysosomal biogenesis, even though this was strongly upregulated in PGRN knockout models ( Tanaka et al., 2017 ). Other  in vitro  cellular systems where PGRN was depleted rather than deleted similarly displayed little transcriptional evidence for a lysosomal phenotype ( Rosen et al., 2011 ). Additional stimuli may, therefore, be required to trigger changes in lysosome mRNA and protein expression in such cells. PGRN is a modular protein, composed of seven and a half granulin subunits, and is digested in lysosomes down to its constituent modules, which are released as granulin peptides ( Salazar et al., 2015 ;  Holler et al., 2017 ). This is unlikely to be a factor in the LRC experiments, however, which were conducted at 4\u00b0C, conditions that make lysosomal uptake and proteolysis unlikely. It will be interesting in future experiments to compare how the membrane interactomes of the different lysosomal granulin peptides compare to that of intact PGRN. Importantly, the lack of a strong lysosome signal in the mRNA and proteomic data suggests that PGRN exerts some biological effects independently of lysosomal protein biogenesis.\nThe highest scoring PGRN-binding plasma membrane protein was the tetraspanin, TSPAN4, with another tetraspanin, TSPAN31, also captured. Tetraspanins are scaffold proteins that potentiate integrin and RTK signaling by assembling molecular microdomains within the plasma membrane ( Termini and Gillette, 2017 ), although little is known about their role in neurons. RET, the RTK signaling subunit of neurotrophic GDNF receptor, was also identified among the putative cell membrane PGRN-binding proteins, although its PGRN-binding signal (2.37-fold) was less prominent than the binding of the classic RTK ligand insulin to its receptor. PGRN expressing cells displayed enhanced RET tyrosine phosphorylation in RTK antibody arrays and Western blot assays, however, this was, at least in part, due to increased RET expression. The relative significance of PGRN interaction with RET versus the change in RET expression levels remain to be determined. Interestingly, GFRA2, an accessory subunit of the GDNF receptor that presents GDNF to RET, was recently identified as an important genetic risk factor for FTD-GRN ( Pottier et al., 2018 ), supporting an interaction between RET and PGRN signaling. In addition to RET, NSC-34/hPGRN cells displayed enhanced phosphorylation of several other RTKs, and a similar pattern of multi-RTK activation, although for a different set of receptors, was seen in the epithelial MDA cell line. Thus, rather than target a specific receptor, high PGRN expression appears to raise the \"tone\" of RTK activity, that is, to mediate a general enhancement of RTK activation. The mechanisms by which PGRN achieves this remain to be defined.\nUnlike RET expression, which was decreased in PGRN depleted NSC-34 cells, many other neurotrophic receptors were upregulated, including RTKs, notably the nerve growth factor receptor, and molecules in the Wnt pathway, especially FZD3, a wnt receptor family member, as well as in the notch, and semaphorin signaling pathways. The upregulation of multiple neurotrophic receptors in NSC-34/shPGRN cells may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain neurotrophic homeostasis in response to the reduced trophic support that would otherwise be supplied by PGRN as has been suggested previously for the wnt-signaling pathway ( Rosen et al., 2011 ;  Alquezar et al., 2014 ;  de la Encarnacion et al., 2016 ). In support of this hypothesis, FZD3, is required for axon development in dorsal motor neurons ( Hua et al., 2013 ). Compensatory activation of alternate receptor-based neurotrophic pathways may contribute to the surprising lack of a strong FTD-like phenotype in heterozygous  Grn +/- mice ( Filiano et al., 2013 ).\nIn conclusion, the response to PGRN expression in NSC-34 cells is complex. PGRN expression elicited cell-autonomous neurotrophic effects on cell size and axon-like extension, and supported the expression of genes for cytoskeletal regulation, and synaptic formation. This appears to be independent of pathways of lysosome biogenesis even though PGRN bound to membrane proteins in the ER/Golgi/lysosome compartments. PGRN was predicted to bind multiple cell surface proteins. The activity of RTK receptors, including RET, was increased in PGRN-rich NSC-34 cells. In conditions of PGRN insufficiency, however, the reduction in PGRN may be partially offset by enhanced expression of other neurotrophic receptors.

Based on results for NSC-34, PGRN may contribute to maintaining their morphology, as high PGRN expression clearly led to cell body enlargement and promoted axon extension, whereas PGRN depleted cells were unable to enlarge, and extensions were often unusually branched and poorly condensed. This, together with the previously reported dependency of NSC-34 cells upon PGRN for survival in the absence of trophic support from serum ( Ryan et al., 2009 ), implies a marked trophic effect for PGRN on NSC-34 cells.\n", "The morphological response to PGRN expression correlated well with molecular phenotypes that included mRNA pathways associated with the regulation of the cytoskeleton. This was further supported by changes in cell adhesion pathways in the proteome of NSC-34/hPGRN and NSC-34/shPGRN cells. PGRN depletion also impacted pathways associated with synaptic structure and function with presynaptic pathways particularly sensitive to PGRN depletion. These observations in NSC-34 cells are consistent with  in vivo  observations, where PGRN exerts complex roles in maintaining synaptic structure and connections ( Tapia et al., 2011 ;  Petkau et al., 2012 ;  Petoukhov et al., 2013 ;  Uesaka et al., 2018 ). Importantly, synaptic defects precede the onset of overt neuropathology in  Grn  knockout mice ( Petkau et al., 2012 ), but it is unclear how PGRN influences synaptic structure. Synaptic pruning by microglia ( Lui et al., 2016 ), and sortilin-mediated PGRN synaptic strengthening between climbing fibers and Purkinje cells during development ( Uesaka et al., 2018 ), have been reported. The results from NSC-34 cells suggest that additional cell-autonomous mechanisms may also be involved.\n", "Progranulin depletion in NSC-34 cells altered the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, although there was no global change in the levels of the quantitatively dominant lipid classes such as di- and triacyl glycerides and phosphatidylserines. Alterations in these lipid classes have, however, been observed in  Grn-/-  and  Grn +/- mouse brains, probably as the result of lysosomal abnormalities ( Evers et al., 2017 ). In contrast, lipids in the less abundant cholesterol ester, ceramide and phosphatidic acid families were elevated in PGRN-depleted NSC-34 cells. Increased ceramide expression is possibly due, in part, to increased CER2 (ceramide synthase 2) expression. There is increasing evidence, however, that PGRN intervenes at several key points in ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism. It modulates the activity of at least two enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism, glucocerebrosidase (GBA) ( Jian et al., 2016a , b ;  Arrant et al., 2019 ;  Valdez et al., 2020 ), and hexosaminidase A ( Chen Y. et al., 2018 ). In addition, it binds to prosaposin, and regulates its trafficking and processing to saponins ( Zhou et al., 2017 ;  Valdez et al., 2020 ) which are non-enzymatic lysosomal proteins that promote sphingolipid catabolism. Ceramides play important roles in neurodegeneration ( Cutler et al., 2004 ), and it will be important to determine to what extent they may contribute to the survival and morphological defects of NSC-34/shPGRN cells.\n", "Although PGRN exercises a strong cell autonomous trophic action in NSC-34 cells, it remains unclear how this is exerted. Since extracellular PGRN replicated these actions, binding to membrane proteins is probably required, and we chose, therefore, to further investigate the properties of PGRN binding to NSC-34 cell membrane proteins. Several putative PGRN receptors and binding proteins have been proposed. Among them are heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( Gonzalez et al., 2003 ;  Yip et al., 2014 ), EphA2 ( Neill et al., 2016 ), Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 ( Tang et al., 2011 ), Toll-like receptor-9 ( Park et al., 2011 ), notch receptors ( Altmann et al., 2016 ), components of lysosomal trafficking such as sortilin ( Hu et al., 2010 ) and prosaposin ( Zhou et al., 2015 ), and lysosomal enzymes involved in lipid and protein metabolism ( Paushter et al., 2018 ). Reconciling these diverse binding proteins into an integrated model of PGRN action is challenging, particularly since PGRN may interact with more than one membrane protein at the same time. We employed LRC, a membrane interactomic strategy to obtain an unbiased survey of membrane-bound PGRN binding proteins in live NSC-34 cells, and thereby probe the nature and range of PGRN binding to membrane proteins. PGRN captured multiple membrane proteins ( Figure 6  and  Supplementary Table 3 ), of which several (12 of 33) have equal or stronger enrichment for PGRN binding than the classic receptor ligand insulin had for its receptor, although with lower  p  values. GNPTA (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunits alpha/beta), for example, has a log2 fold enrichment of 8.31 (or 317 in natural numbers), compared to a log2 fold enrichment of 2.23 for the insulin receptor. The lower  p  values in the PGRN versus the insulin arm are probably due to the capture of fewer unique peptides per protein than for the insulin receptor. Although some captured proteins may be false positives, the strong enrichment of PGRN binding to its putative partners, often greater than that of insulin for its receptor, together with the identification of established PGRN proteins such as sortilin, and the limited number of proteins in the PGRN capture set (33) versus the set of all glycoproteins identified (1746), suggests that the observed multiplicity of binding is an authentic reflection of how PGRN interacts with NSC-34 cells. The multiplicity of binding partners in the same cell type is consistent with reports, noted above, of multiple putative PGRN binding proteins, and suggests that PGRN may act on complexes or networks of binding proteins, rather than single dedicated receptors, as has, indeed been found for its interaction with lysosomal proteins ( Paushter et al., 2018 ;  Cui et al., 2019 ).\n", "Most predicted PGRN membrane-protein partners in NSC-34 cells were located either within the plasma membrane (19/33 proteins) or the ER/Golgi/lysosome compartments (12 proteins). The enrichment of GO terms for lysosomal transport in predicted protein interaction networks supports the role of PGRN in lysosomal functions. Interestingly, however, neither the transcriptomic nor proteomic analyses detected a consistent effect of PGRN depletion on lysosomal biogenesis, even though this was strongly upregulated in PGRN knockout models ( Tanaka et al., 2017 ). Other  in vitro  cellular systems where PGRN was depleted rather than deleted similarly displayed little transcriptional evidence for a lysosomal phenotype ( Rosen et al., 2011 ). Additional stimuli may, therefore, be required to trigger changes in lysosome mRNA and protein expression in such cells. PGRN is a modular protein, composed of seven and a half granulin subunits, and is digested in lysosomes down to its constituent modules, which are released as granulin peptides ( Salazar et al., 2015 ;  Holler et al., 2017 ). This is unlikely to be a factor in the LRC experiments, however, which were conducted at 4\u00b0C, conditions that make lysosomal uptake and proteolysis unlikely. It will be interesting in future experiments to compare how the membrane interactomes of the different lysosomal granulin peptides compare to that of intact PGRN. Importantly, the lack of a strong lysosome signal in the mRNA and proteomic data suggests that PGRN exerts some biological effects independently of lysosomal protein biogenesis.\n", "The highest scoring PGRN-binding plasma membrane protein was the tetraspanin, TSPAN4, with another tetraspanin, TSPAN31, also captured. Tetraspanins are scaffold proteins that potentiate integrin and RTK signaling by assembling molecular microdomains within the plasma membrane ( Termini and Gillette, 2017 ), although little is known about their role in neurons. RET, the RTK signaling subunit of neurotrophic GDNF receptor, was also identified among the putative cell membrane PGRN-binding proteins, although its PGRN-binding signal (2.37-fold) was less prominent than the binding of the classic RTK ligand insulin to its receptor. PGRN expressing cells displayed enhanced RET tyrosine phosphorylation in RTK antibody arrays and Western blot assays, however, this was, at least in part, due to increased RET expression. The relative significance of PGRN interaction with RET versus the change in RET expression levels remain to be determined. Interestingly, GFRA2, an accessory subunit of the GDNF receptor that presents GDNF to RET, was recently identified as an important genetic risk factor for FTD-GRN ( Pottier et al., 2018 ), supporting an interaction between RET and PGRN signaling. In addition to RET, NSC-34/hPGRN cells displayed enhanced phosphorylation of several other RTKs, and a similar pattern of multi-RTK activation, although for a different set of receptors, was seen in the epithelial MDA cell line. Thus, rather than target a specific receptor, high PGRN expression appears to raise the \"tone\" of RTK activity, that is, to mediate a general enhancement of RTK activation. The mechanisms by which PGRN achieves this remain to be defined.\n", "Unlike RET expression, which was decreased in PGRN depleted NSC-34 cells, many other neurotrophic receptors were upregulated, including RTKs, notably the nerve growth factor receptor, and molecules in the Wnt pathway, especially FZD3, a wnt receptor family member, as well as in the notch, and semaphorin signaling pathways. The upregulation of multiple neurotrophic receptors in NSC-34/shPGRN cells may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain neurotrophic homeostasis in response to the reduced trophic support that would otherwise be supplied by PGRN as has been suggested previously for the wnt-signaling pathway ( Rosen et al., 2011 ;  Alquezar et al., 2014 ;  de la Encarnacion et al., 2016 ). In support of this hypothesis, FZD3, is required for axon development in dorsal motor neurons ( Hua et al., 2013 ). Compensatory activation of alternate receptor-based neurotrophic pathways may contribute to the surprising lack of a strong FTD-like phenotype in heterozygous  Grn +/- mice ( Filiano et al., 2013 ).\n", "In conclusion, the response to PGRN expression in NSC-34 cells is complex. PGRN expression elicited cell-autonomous neurotrophic effects on cell size and axon-like extension, and supported the expression of genes for cytoskeletal regulation, and synaptic formation. This appears to be independent of pathways of lysosome biogenesis even though PGRN bound to membrane proteins in the ER/Golgi/lysosome compartments. PGRN was predicted to bind multiple cell surface proteins. The activity of RTK receptors, including RET, was increased in PGRN-rich NSC-34 cells. In conditions of PGRN insufficiency, however, the reduction in PGRN may be partially offset by enhanced expression of other neurotrophic receptors. The multiplicity of PGRN interactions with membrane proteins make it unlikely that its neurotrophic actions are mediated through a simple linear receptor signaling pathway. It may instead act through interaction with networks or complexes of membrane protein interactions. Understanding the roles of these pathways in PGRN action, and how they interrelate, and their relevance to the pathology of PGRN insufficiency will provide insights toward improved neurosupportive therapies in neurodegenerative diseases.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "7953906_Materials and Methods", "text": ["\nStudy Design and Participants\nWe conducted a cohort study in hospitalized patients (N = 68) with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection (hereinafter referred to as influenza) that attended the emergency department of the National Institute for Respiratory Diseases (INER) of Mexico during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 flu seasons. Patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) that progressed to ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were eligible. These subjects were screened for influenza using a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT; Fuji dri-chem immuno AG cartridge FluAB kit, Fujifilm Corp, Tokyo, Japan) in fresh respiratory swab specimens. Simultaneously, further molecular characterization of the causative influenza virus subtype was assessed by RT-PCR, as previously described ( 6 ).\nIn addition, we included a group of patients with COVID-19 (N = 24) that attended INER or the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition (INCMNSZ) in Mexico City, from March to May of 2020. The infection with SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR, as described below ( 7 ). We also enrolled a third cohort of individuals with active PTB (N = 30) recruited at the \"Tuberculosis Clinic\" of the INER in Mexico City. The diagnosis of PTB was performed by direct clinical examination, radiological evaluation, and microbiological analyses of sputum specimens, as described before ( 8 ). None of the patients enrolled in the study had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We retrieved clinical and demographic data from the participants. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each patient within the first 24 h following hospital admission to determine serum CXCL17 levels. An additional blood sample was obtained from patients with influenza seven days after admission. Healthy volunteer individuals (N = 30) were also recruited to participate in the study and served as controls.\nRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Detection\nBriefly, viral RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). The RT-PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl, containing 5 \u03bcl of RNA, 12.5 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 reaction buffer provided with the Superscript III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany; containing 0.4 mM of each deoxyribose triphosphates (dNTP) and 3.2 mM magnesium sulfate), 1\u03bcl of reverse transcriptase/Taq mixture from the kit, 0.4 \u03bcl of a 50 mM magnesium sulfate solution (Invitrogen), and 1 \u03bcg of non-acetylated bovine serum albumin (Roche). Primer and probe sequences, as well as optimized concentrations, are shown in  Supplementary Table 1 \n \n . All oligonucleotides were synthesized and provided by Tib-Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Thermal cycling was performed at 55\u00b0C for 10 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95\u00b0C for 3 min and then 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s.\n\n In Vitro  Infection Assays With Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 Virus\nInfluenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was isolated from patients with severe pneumonia in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Virus infectivity was assessed by titration of tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID 50 ) in MDCK cells, as previously described ( 9 ). Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells A549 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonza) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Human macrophages were obtained and cultured as described before ( 9 ). A549 epithelial cells and macrophages were infected with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for one hour. Mock-treated cells received a virus-free culture medium. After incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Media containing the influenza virus was replaced with a virus-free culture medium. Supernatants were collected after 24, 48, and 72 h, for CXCL17 quantitation.\nCXCL17 Levels\nLevels of CXCL17 in human serum and culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit (MBS916471, My BioSource, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.\nHistological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry\nFormalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lung autopsy specimens from patients who died of influenza or COVID-19 (N = 2 patients per group) were obtained from the Pathology Department of the INER. Sections of 3-5 \u03bcm were processed for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining for histopathological analysis. For immunohistochemistry (IHQ), lung sections were mounted on silane-covered slides, deparaffinized, and the endogenous peroxidase blocked. Sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with an optimal dilution (1:100) of the Mouse Anti-Human CXCL17/VCC-1 Monoclonal Antibody (Clone # 422208, MAB4207, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Secondary biotinylated antibodies labeled with peroxidase were added, and those attached were revealed with diaminobenzidine (ImmunoCruz\u2122 rabbit ABC Staining System, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin.\nEthics Statement\nThe current study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the INER (approval number: B04-15, B28-16 and B09-20) and the INCMNSZ (approval number: 3349) in Mexico City. All participants or their legal guardians provided written consent to participate in the study. Serum samples were managed according to the Mexican law NOM-012-SSA3-2012, which establishes the criteria for the execution of clinical investigations in humans.\nStatistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterize the population under study clinically. Frequencies and proportions were calculated for categorical data. Means, medians, standard deviations (SD), interquartile ranges (IQR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for continuous variables. Differences in categorical variables between groups were assessed by the Fisher exact or Chi-square test, as appropriate. For comparisons of continuous variables between two groups, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. For differences of continuous data between more than two groups, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test with  post hoc  Dunn test. Differences in serum levels of CXCL17 measured in serial samples were determined using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Multiple linear regression analyses using Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations between continuous clinical variables and serum levels of CXCL17. The K-means algorithm was used for clustering study participant characteristics according to their diagnosis (influenza or COVID-19) and clinical outcome (survival or fatality). Before data visualization, clinical features and laboratory parameters were scaled and centered.\nTo identify the variables with the highest impact on disease diagnosis (influenza, COVID-19) and adverse outcomes (death), random forest analyses of 500 classification and regression trees (CARTs) were performed. The diagnostic accuracy of serum CXCL17 levels and other selected variables identified by random forest logarithm was further evaluated by bivariate logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analyses. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to look for differences in survival according to serum CXCL17 levels dichotomized by the ROC curve threshold with the highest diagnostic accuracy estimated using the Youden index.

Patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) that progressed to ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were eligible. These subjects were screened for influenza using a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT; Fuji dri-chem immuno AG cartridge FluAB kit, Fujifilm Corp, Tokyo, Japan) in fresh respiratory swab specimens. Simultaneously, further molecular characterization of the causative influenza virus subtype was assessed by RT-PCR, as previously described ( 6 ).\n", "In addition, we included a group of patients with COVID-19 (N = 24) that attended INER or the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition (INCMNSZ) in Mexico City, from March to May of 2020. The infection with SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR, as described below ( 7 ). We also enrolled a third cohort of individuals with active PTB (N = 30) recruited at the \"Tuberculosis Clinic\" of the INER in Mexico City. The diagnosis of PTB was performed by direct clinical examination, radiological evaluation, and microbiological analyses of sputum specimens, as described before ( 8 ). None of the patients enrolled in the study had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We retrieved clinical and demographic data from the participants. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each patient within the first 24 h following hospital admission to determine serum CXCL17 levels. An additional blood sample was obtained from patients with influenza seven days after admission. Healthy volunteer individuals (N = 30) were also recruited to participate in the study and served as controls.\n", "RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 Detection\nBriefly, viral RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). The RT-PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl, containing 5 \u03bcl of RNA, 12.5 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 reaction buffer provided with the Superscript III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany; containing 0.4 mM of each deoxyribose triphosphates (dNTP) and 3.2 mM magnesium sulfate), 1\u03bcl of reverse transcriptase/Taq mixture from the kit, 0.4 \u03bcl of a 50 mM magnesium sulfate solution (Invitrogen), and 1 \u03bcg of non-acetylated bovine serum albumin (Roche). Primer and probe sequences, as well as optimized concentrations, are shown in  Supplementary Table 1 \n \n . All oligonucleotides were synthesized and provided by Tib-Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Thermal cycling was performed at 55\u00b0C for 10 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95\u00b0C for 3 min and then 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s.\n", "\n In Vitro  Infection Assays With Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 Virus\nInfluenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus was isolated from patients with severe pneumonia in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Virus infectivity was assessed by titration of tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID 50 ) in MDCK cells, as previously described ( 9 ). Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells A549 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonza) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . Human macrophages were obtained and cultured as described before ( 9 ). A549 epithelial cells and macrophages were infected with influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for one hour. Mock-treated cells received a virus-free culture medium. After incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Media containing the influenza virus was replaced with a virus-free culture medium. Supernatants were collected after 24, 48, and 72 h, for CXCL17 quantitation.\n", "CXCL17 Levels\nLevels of CXCL17 in human serum and culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit (MBS916471, My BioSource, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.\n", "Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry\nFormalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lung autopsy specimens from patients who died of influenza or COVID-19 (N = 2 patients per group) were obtained from the Pathology Department of the INER. Sections of 3-5 \u03bcm were processed for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining for histopathological analysis. For immunohistochemistry (IHQ), lung sections were mounted on silane-covered slides, deparaffinized, and the endogenous peroxidase blocked. Sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with an optimal dilution (1:100) of the Mouse Anti-Human CXCL17/VCC-1 Monoclonal Antibody (Clone # 422208, MAB4207, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Secondary biotinylated antibodies labeled with peroxidase were added, and those attached were revealed with diaminobenzidine (ImmunoCruz\u2122 rabbit ABC Staining System, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin.\n", "Ethics Statement\nThe current study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the INER (approval number: B04-15, B28-16 and B09-20) and the INCMNSZ (approval number: 3349) in Mexico City. All participants or their legal guardians provided written consent to participate in the study. Serum samples were managed according to the Mexican law NOM-012-SSA3-2012, which establishes the criteria for the execution of clinical investigations in humans.\n", "Statistical Analysis\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterize the population under study clinically. Frequencies and proportions were calculated for categorical data. Means, medians, standard deviations (SD), interquartile ranges (IQR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for continuous variables. Differences in categorical variables between groups were assessed by the Fisher exact or Chi-square test, as appropriate. For comparisons of continuous variables between two groups, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. For differences of continuous data between more than two groups, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test with  post hoc  Dunn test. Differences in serum levels of CXCL17 measured in serial samples were determined using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. Multiple linear regression analyses using Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations between continuous clinical variables and serum levels of CXCL17. The K-means algorithm was used for clustering study participant characteristics according to their diagnosis (influenza or COVID-19) and clinical outcome (survival or fatality). Before data visualization, clinical features and laboratory parameters were scaled and centered.\n", "To identify the variables with the highest impact on disease diagnosis (influenza, COVID-19) and adverse outcomes (death), random forest analyses of 500 classification and regression trees (CARTs) were performed. The diagnostic accuracy of serum CXCL17 levels and other selected variables identified by random forest logarithm was further evaluated by bivariate logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analyses. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to look for differences in survival according to serum CXCL17 levels dichotomized by the ROC curve threshold with the highest diagnostic accuracy estimated using the Youden index.

Also, most laboratory parameters routinely tested in emergency departments did not differ between individuals with influenza and COVID-19. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and procalcitonin were increased in influenza patients as compared to COVID-19 subjects ( Table 1 \n \n ). Similarly, severity of illness scores at admission, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II), were higher in influenza cases. We should note that despite this, COVID-19 patients showed higher mortality compared to influenza (41  vs . 23%,  p  = 0.1151).\nAn additional cohort of 30 patients with active PTB were included in the study. These individuals were sex-matched with influenza patients. However, they presented some differences regarding their clinical and demographic characteristics. First, PTB patients were younger than influenza subjects, with a median age of 38 years. Sixty-six percent were males and showed a lower body mass index (BMI) than influenza and COVID-19 patients. There were no differences in the prevalence of diabetes between groups. Finally, although PTB showed a milder and chronic clinical disease with regards to influenza and COVID-19, they had high degrees of lung damage according to their scores in a quantitative scale that evaluates changes on chest radiographs (data not shown) ( 10 ).\nExpression of CXCL17 in the Lung of Patients With Influenza or COVID-19\nCXCL17 is constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract and lungs of mice and humans ( 1 ,  2 ). Under inflammatory conditions, the production of this chemokine is known to be further upregulated ( 2 ,  4 ,  5 ,  11 ,  12 ). To investigate whether CXCL17 may participate in immunity against the influenza A(H1N1) virus, we analyzed the tissue expression pattern of CXCL17 in lung autopsy specimens obtained from patients who died of influenza. The histological changes induced in the lungs during influenza were mainly characterized by intra-alveolar inflammatory infiltrates consisting of macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells scattered between areas of edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin deposits ( Figure 1A \n \n , left upper panel). We also noted that the integrity of alveolar walls and the micro-architecture of the lung were conserved in influenza patients ( Supplementary Figure 1 \n \n ). CXCL17 expression was detected mainly within the cytoplasm of infiltrating macrophages, but not in polymorphonuclear cells. The expression of CXCL17 was also detected within alveolar epithelial cells ( Figure 1A \n \n , left lower panel). Blood vessels and pleura did not express CXCL17 in lung autopsy specimens from influenza patients (data not shown).\nWe also evaluated the tissue-expression pattern of CXCL17 in lungs of patients that succumbed to COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 induced distinctive morphological changes in the infected lung, characterized by an intense inflammatory infiltrate affecting extensive areas of the parenchyma, as well as the thickness of alveolar walls, and partial loss of the histological architecture of the lung ( Supplementary Figure 1 \n \n  and  Figure 1A \n \n , right upper panel). These changes are compatible with interstitial pneumonia. As observed in influenza infected lung sections, the expression of CXCL17 in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients was also detected within macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells ( Figure 1A \n \n , right lower panel). CXCL17 was not expressed in endothelial cells of alveolar capillaries, but pleura showed increased CXCL17 expression (data not shown). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CXCL17 can be detected in the lungs during influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nHigh Serum Levels of CXCL17 Distinguish Influenza From Other Respiratory Infections\nAlthough CXCL17 is mainly produced at mucosal surfaces, increased serum levels of this chemokine might serve as a readout of active local immune responses. Thus, we addressed whether the CXCL17 expression found in the lungs of influenza- and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could be also detected in the serum. Our results indicate that CXCL17 levels were significatively elevated in the serum of influenza cases, but not in healthy donors (HD) or COVID-19 subjects. The latter group indeed showed low serum CXCL17 levels, similar to the levels observed in HD ( Figure 1B \n \n ). These findings contrast with the expression of CXCL17 detected in the lung of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that the levels of CXCL17 in serum and its expression in lung tissue specimens do not correlate during the course of the disease. Nonetheless, our lung immunohistochemical analyses only focused on the expression of this chemokine in the late stages of influenza and COVID-19, whereas serum samples were taken within the first day after patients\u00b4 hospital admission. We also measured the levels of CXCL17 in serum samples from PTB patients. Notably, we found that the levels of the chemokine in PTB individuals were much lower compared to those observed in influenza patients ( Figure 1B \n \n ). In contrast, no differences in serum CXCL17 levels were observed between COVID-19 and PTB patients. These findings suggest distinctive serum CXCL17 dynamics during influenza, COVID-19, and PTB that could potentially be harnessed for diagnostic purposes. This is important since influenza and COVID-19 will converge at some point during the ongoing winter in the North Hemisphere. As such, physicians will require novel rapidly testable diagnostic biomarkers to discriminate both diseases, specially at setting of limited availability of RT-PCR tests.\nHence, next we investigated if CXCL17, along with other clinical characteristics, could have certain diagnostic value to discriminate between both viral infections. In an unsupervised clustering analysis, we found that some influenza patients grouped together according to their clinical and laboratory parameters, but another cluster was formed by combined influenza and COVID-19 subjects ( Figure 1C \n \n ). This suggests that the differentiation of the two infections by clinical characteristics would be difficult in the emergency room. Nonetheless, in a random forest analysis, CXCL17 was among the most explicative variables of the viral subtype ( Figure 1D \n \n ). Indeed, in a bivariate logistic regression analysis using the variables identified in the random forest algorithm, only CXCL17, along with procalcitonin, showed significant association with influenza ( Supplementary Figure 2 \n \n ). LDH and ALP were marginally associated with influenza, whereas platelets showed no correlation with any type of infection. Interestingly, although irrelevant in the random forest algorithm, symptoms such as dyspnea, rhinorrhea, and sputum production were predictors of influenza, whereas dry cough and vomit were associated with COVID-19.\nTo further estimate the diagnostic value of CXCL17, we performed a ROC curve analysis with the serum levels of CXCL17 of influenza and COVID-19 subjects. We observed that CXCL17 levels could reliably differentiate between influenza and COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.81 ( Figure 1E \n \n ). Using a cut-off value of 841 pg/ml, elevated serum levels of this chemokine have a 78.2% sensitivity, 73.5% specificity, 89.2% PPV, 51.3% NPV, and an OR of 8.79 (3.1-26, 95% CI) to distinguish influenza from COVID-19. Together, our results point to the diagnostic use of serum CXCL17 levels in patients with acute respiratory illness to enable distinguishing infection between these viruses, although these findings must be validated in larger cohorts of patients, as well as in patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses.\nDynamics and Prognostic Value of Serum CXCL17 Levels in Influenza\nNext, we evaluated the dynamics of serum CXCL17 levels during influenza. For this purpose, we grouped influenza patients according to the duration of their illness, defined as the period from symptom onset to hospital admission. Interestingly, we found that levels of CXCL17 increased early in influenza patients within the first two days following the onset of symptoms, and levels remained increased during the first two weeks of illness. However, the maximum levels of CXCL17 were observed among influenza patients seeking medical attention three weeks after the onset of symptoms ( Figure 2A \n \n ). In 54 of the 68 influenza patients enrolled in the study, an additional serum sample was obtained seven days (D7) following hospital admission (D0). Although there were no differences in CXCL17 between D0 and D7, most patients showed constant or decreasing chemokine levels ( Figure 2B \n \n ), except for one individual who showed a notable increase in CXCL17 and succumbed to the infection. Overall, the dynamics of CXCL17 levels post-hospital admission were similar in survivors and deceased influenza patients ( Figure 2C \n \n ).\nImportantly, serum levels of CXCL17 at D0 were significatively higher in patients who died of influenza as compared to survivors ( Figure 2D \n \n ). Indeed, CXCL17 again was among the variables with the higher importance for influenza-associated mortality in a random forest analysis ( Figure 2E \n \n ), showing an AUC of 0.70 to differentiate both groups in the ROC curve analysis ( Figure 2F \n \n ). Serum levels of CXCL17 above 1,128 pg/ml predicted a fatal outcome with a 75% sensitivity and 50% specificity, showing a non-significant OR value for mortality of 3.0 (0.86-9.24, 95% CI). The survival of patients with CXCL17 below such cut-off value was lower at day 14 after admission when compared to individuals with higher levels of this chemokine ( Figure 2G \n \n ,  Table 2 \n \n ). Conversely, accumulated survival at days 28 and 60 following hospital admission was lower in influenza patients with serum levels of CXCL17 \u22651,128 pg/ml.\n\n           Table 2 \n           Cumulative survival rates in patients with influenza according with their serum CXCL17 levels. \n           \n             \n           Time after hospital admission \n                 Survival (%, 95% CI) \n               \n                 \n               CXCL17 <1,128 pg/ml \n                 CXCL17 \u2265 1,128 pg/ml \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n             7 days \n                 96.66 (78.6-99.52) \n                 94.73 (80.55-98.65) \n               \n                 \n               14 days \n                 84.86 (64.38-94.06) \n                 91.776 (76.56-97.27) \n               \n                 \n               21 days \n                 84.86 (64.38-94.06) \n                 85.06 (67.5-94.16) \n               \n                 \n               28 days \n                 84.86 (64.38-94.06) \n                 63.33 (41.48-78.89) \n               \n                 \n               60 days \n                 84.86 (64.38-94.06) \n                 31.66 (1.93-71.53) \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n           Survival rates and their 95% CI were estimated using the Kaplan-Meyer method and the log rank test. \n           \n             \n        \nMost clinical and laboratory parameters did not differ between the two groups of influenza patients ( Supplementary Table 2 \n \n ). Furthermore, none of these clinical characteristics impacted the serum levels of CXCL17 ( Figure 3A \n \n ), and this chemokine was not associated with the severity of ARDS in terms of the PaO2/FiO2 values at admission ( Figure 3B \n \n ). These results together suggest that CXCL17 represents an independent prognostic factor for mortality in influenza. In contrast, no differences in serum CXCL17 levels at admission were observed between survivor- and deceased-COVID-19 patients ( Figure 3C \n \n ), and this chemokine showed no correlation with the lung damage score of patients with PTB ( Supplementary Figure 3 \n \n ).\nWe also noted that CXCL17 was increased among influenza patients that developed acute kidney injury (AKIN;  Figure 3D \n \n ), and its levels were even higher in individuals requiring renal replacement therapy ( Figure 3E \n \n ). Using the same cut-off value of 1,128pg/mL, elevated serum levels of CXCL17 showed a 73.6% sensitivity, 51% specificity, and a non-significant OR of 2.91 (0.96-8.28, 95% CI) to predict the development of AKIN ( Figure 3F \n \n ). Similarly, increased levels of CXCL17 showed an 87.5% sensitivity, 53.8% specificity, and a significant OR of 8.16 (1.71-38, 95% CI) to predict the need for renal replacement therapy ( Figure 3G \n \n ).\nInfluenza A(H1N1) pdm09 Virus Induces the Production of CXCL17 in Human Lung Epithelial Cells and Macrophages\nThe higher levels of CXCL17 in sera from influenza patients prompted us to investigate the possible cellular sources of CXCL17 during influenza. To this end, we infected human A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages with a clinical isolate of the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus. Interestingly, while both human cell types produced high amounts of CXCL17 at 24 h, 48h, and 72h after the infection, A549 epithelial cells produced lower levels of CXCL17 in response to influenza as compared to macrophages ( Figures 3H, I \n \n ). These findings are consistent with the expression of CXCL17 in lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells in autopsy specimens from our influenza patients. This suggests that the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus stimulates CXCL17 expression in humans, both  in vivo  and  in vitro . However, further analyses are required to confirm a role for CXCL17 in influenza.\n"], "ner": [[[66, 75, "DISEASE"], [187, 196, "DISEASE"], [283, 291, "DISEASE"], [377, 386, "DISEASE"], [426, 434,

We also recruited 24 patients with COVID-19, from which most were males (75%), with a median age of 50 years. Most patients with influenza presented similar characteristics than COVID-19, except for some specific differences. For instance, obesity was more common among influenza patients, while the prevalence of other comorbidities did not differ between both diseases. Cough, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, and arthralgia were the most frequent symptoms of respiratory illness in both participant groups. Interestingly, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, and sputum production were more common during influenza, whereas dry cough and vomit were more frequent among COVID-19 patients ( Table 1 \n \n ).\n", "\n           Table 1 \n           Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of study participants. \n", "           \n             \n           Characteristics \n                 Influenza, N = 68A \n                 COVID-19, N = 24B \n", "                 p -value, A  vs  B \n \n                 PTB, N = 30C \n                 p -value, A  vs  C \n", " \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n             Age (years), median (range) \n", " \n \n                 48 (20-77) \n                 50 (28-73) \n                 0.6536 \n                 39 (20-46) \n", "                 0.0010 \n               \n                 \n               Males \n \n \n                 48 (70.5) \n", "                 18 (75) \n                 0.7953 \n                 20 (66.6) \n                 0.8126 \n", "               \n                 \n               BMI \n \n \n                 33.4 (30-38.2) \n                 28.9 (25.2-30.3) \n", "                 <0.0001 \n                 20.6 (18.8-23.1) \n                 <0.0001 \n               \n", "                 \n               Comorbidities \n \n \n                 \n                 \n                 \n", "                 \n                 \n               \n                 \n               Smoking \n                 27 (39.7) \n", "                 5 (20.8) \n                 0.1349 \n                 0 (0) \n                 <0.0001 \n", "               \n                 \n               Diabetes \n                 14 (20.5) \n                 7 (29.1) \n", "                 0.4063 \n                 11 (36.6) \n                 0.1306 \n               \n                 \n", "               SAH \n                 18 (26.4) \n                 5 (20.8) \n                 0.7848 \n", "                 2 (6.6) \n                 0.0295 \n               \n                 \n               OSA \n", "                 4 (5.8) \n                 0 (0) \n                 0.5695 \n                 0 (0) \n                 0.3095 \n", "               \n                 \n               COPD \n                 3 (4.4) \n                 1 (4.1) \n", "                 >0.9999 \n                 0 (0) \n                 0.5507 \n               \n                 \n", "               Symptoms at onset \n \n \n                 \n                 \n                 \n                 \n", "                 \n               \n                 \n               Fever \n                 62 (91.1) \n", "                 18 (75) \n                 0.0725 \n                 -

Also, most laboratory parameters routinely tested in emergency departments did not differ between individuals with influenza and COVID-19. The levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and procalcitonin were increased in influenza patients as compared to COVID-19 subjects ( Table 1 \n \n ). Similarly, severity of illness scores at admission, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II), were higher in influenza cases. We should note that despite this, COVID-19 patients showed higher mortality compared to influenza (41  vs . 23%,  p  = 0.1151).\n", "An additional cohort of 30 patients with active PTB were included in the study. These individuals were sex-matched with influenza patients. However, they presented some differences regarding their clinical and demographic characteristics. First, PTB patients were younger than influenza subjects, with a median age of 38 years. Sixty-six percent were males and showed a lower body mass index (BMI) than influenza and COVID-19 patients. There were no differences in the prevalence of diabetes between groups. Finally, although PTB showed a milder and chronic clinical disease with regards to influenza and COVID-19, they had high degrees of lung damage according to their scores in a quantitative scale that evaluates changes on chest radiographs (data not shown) ( 10 ).\n", "Expression of CXCL17 in the Lung of Patients With Influenza or COVID-19\nCXCL17 is constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract and lungs of mice and humans ( 1 ,  2 ). Under inflammatory conditions, the production of this chemokine is known to be further upregulated ( 2 ,  4 ,  5 ,  11 ,  12 ). To investigate whether CXCL17 may participate in immunity against the influenza A(H1N1) virus, we analyzed the tissue expression pattern of CXCL17 in lung autopsy specimens obtained from patients who died of influenza. The histological changes induced in the lungs during influenza were mainly characterized by intra-alveolar inflammatory infiltrates consisting of macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells scattered between areas of edema, hemorrhage, and fibrin deposits ( Figure 1A \n \n , left upper panel). We also noted that the integrity of alveolar walls and the micro-architecture of the lung were conserved in influenza patients ( Supplementary Figure 1 \n \n ). CXCL17 expression was detected mainly within the cytoplasm of infiltrating macrophages, but not in polymorphonuclear cells. The expression of CXCL17 was also detected within alveolar epithelial cells ( Figure 1A \n \n , left lower panel). Blood vessels and pleura did not express CXCL17 in lung autopsy specimens from influenza patients (data not shown).\n", "We also evaluated the tissue-expression pattern of CXCL17 in lungs of patients that succumbed to COVID-19. Interestingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 induced distinctive morphological changes in the infected lung, characterized by an intense inflammatory infiltrate affecting extensive areas of the parenchyma, as well as the thickness of alveolar walls, and partial loss of the histological architecture of the lung ( Supplementary Figure 1 \n \n  and  Figure 1A \n \n , right upper panel). These changes are compatible with interstitial pneumonia. As observed in influenza infected lung sections, the expression of CXCL17 in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients was also detected within macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells ( Figure 1A \n \n , right lower panel). CXCL17 was not expressed in endothelial cells of alveolar capillaries, but pleura showed increased CXCL17 expression (data not shown). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CXCL17 can be detected in the lungs during influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n", "High Serum Levels of CXCL17 Distinguish Influenza From Other Respiratory Infections\nAlthough CXCL17 is mainly produced at mucosal surfaces, increased serum levels of this chemokine might serve as a readout of active local immune responses. Thus, we addressed whether the CXCL17 expression found in the lungs of influenza- and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients could be also detected in the serum. Our results indicate that CXCL17 levels were significatively elevated in the serum of influenza cases, but not in healthy donors (HD) or COVID-19 subjects. The latter group indeed showed low serum CXCL17 levels, similar to the levels observed in HD ( Figure 1B \n \n ). These findings contrast with the expression of CXCL17 detected in the lung of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that the levels of CXCL17 in serum and its expression in lung tissue specimens do not correlate during the course of the disease. Nonetheless, our lung immunohistochemical analyses only focused on the expression of this chemokine in the late stages of influenza and COVID-19, whereas serum samples were taken within the first day after patients\u00b4 hospital admission. We also measured the levels of CXCL17 in serum samples from PTB patients. Notably, we found that the levels of the chemokine in PTB individuals were much lower compared to those observed in influenza patients ( Figure 1B \n \n ). In contrast, no differences in serum CXCL17 levels were observed between COVID-19 and PTB patients. These findings suggest distinctive serum CXCL17 dynamics during influenza, COVID-19, and PTB that could potentially be harnessed for diagnostic purposes. This is important since influenza and COVID-19 will converge at some point during the ongoing winter in the North Hemisphere. As such, physicians will require novel rapidly testable diagnostic biomarkers to discriminate both diseases, specially at setting of limited availability of RT-PCR tests.\n", "Hence, next we investigated if CXCL17, along with other clinical characteristics, could have certain diagnostic value to discriminate between both viral infections. In an unsupervised clustering analysis, we found that some influenza patients grouped together according to their clinical and laboratory parameters, but another cluster was formed by combined influenza and COVID-19 subjects ( Figure 1C \n \n ). This suggests that the differentiation of the two infections by clinical characteristics would be difficult in the emergency room. Nonetheless, in a random forest analysis, CXCL17 was among the most explicative variables of the viral subtype ( Figure 1D \n \n ). Indeed, in a bivariate logistic regression analysis using the variables identified in the random forest algorithm, only CXCL17, along with procalcitonin, showed significant association with influenza ( Supplementary Figure 2 \n \n ). LDH and ALP were marginally associated with influenza, whereas platelets showed no correlation with any type of infection. Interestingly, although irrelevant in the random forest algorithm, symptoms such as dyspnea, rhinorrhea, and sputum production were predictors of influenza, whereas dry cough and vomit were associated with COVID-19.\n", "To further estimate the diagnostic value of CXCL17, we performed a ROC curve analysis with the serum levels of CXCL17 of influenza and COVID-19 subjects. We observed that CXCL17 levels could reliably differentiate between influenza and COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.81 ( Figure 1E \n \n ). Using a cut-off value of 841 pg/ml, elevated serum levels of this chemokine have a 78.2% sensitivity, 73.5% specificity, 89.2% PPV, 51.3% NPV, and an OR of 8.79 (3.1-26, 95% CI) to distinguish influenza from COVID-19. Together, our results point to the diagnostic use of serum CXCL17 levels in patients with acute respiratory illness to enable distinguishing infection between these viruses, although these findings must be validated in larger cohorts of patients, as well as in patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses.\n", "Dynamics and Prognostic Value of Serum CXCL17 Levels in Influenza\nNext, we evaluated the dynamics of serum CXCL17 levels during influenza. For this purpose, we grouped influenza patients according to the duration of their illness, defined as the period from symptom onset to hospital admission. Interestingly, we found that levels of CXCL17 increased early in influenza patients within the first two days following the onset of symptoms, and levels remained increased during the first two weeks of illness. However, the maximum levels of CXCL17 were observed among influenza patients seeking medical attention three weeks after the onset of symptoms ( Figure 2A \n \n ). In 54 of the 68 influenza patients enrolled in the study, an additional serum sample was obtained seven days (D7) following hospital admission (D0). Although there were no differences in CXCL17 between D0 and D7, most patients showed constant or decreasing chemokine levels ( Figure 2B \n \n ), except for one individual who showed a notable increase in CXCL17 and succumbed to the infection. Overall, the dynamics of CXCL17 levels post-hospital admission were similar in survivors and deceased influenza patients ( Figure 2C \n \n ).\n", "Importantly, serum levels of CXCL17 at D0 were significatively higher in patients who died of influenza as compared to survivors ( Figure 2D \n \n ). Indeed, CXCL17 again was among the variables with the higher importance for influenza-associated mortality in a random forest analysis ( Figure 2E \n \n ), showing an AUC of 0.70 to differentiate both groups in the ROC curve analysis ( Figure 2F \n \n ).

These results together suggest that CXCL17 represents an independent prognostic factor for mortality in influenza. In contrast, no differences in serum CXCL17 levels at admission were observed between survivor- and deceased-COVID-19 patients ( Figure 3C \n \n ), and this chemokine showed no correlation with the lung damage score of patients with PTB ( Supplementary Figure 3 \n \n ).\n", "We also noted that CXCL17 was increased among influenza patients that developed acute kidney injury (AKIN;  Figure 3D \n \n ), and its levels were even higher in individuals requiring renal replacement therapy ( Figure 3E \n \n ).

To this end, we infected human A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages with a clinical isolate of the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus. Interestingly, while both human cell types produced high amounts of CXCL17 at 24 h, 48h, and 72h after the infection, A549 epithelial cells produced lower levels of CXCL17 in response to influenza as compared to macrophages ( Figures 3H, I \n \n ). These findings are consistent with the expression of CXCL17 in lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells in autopsy specimens from our influenza patients. This suggests that the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus stimulates CXCL17 expression in humans, both  in vivo  and  in vitro .

{"doc_key": "7953906_Discussion", "text": ["\nThe clinical spectrum of ARDS encompasses very severe forms of the disease characterized by a profound respiratory failure. These manifestations are often related to dysregulated immune reactions elicited by different insults. The quality and magnitude of such responses may vary according to the causative agent of the illness. Thus, particular immune profiles of local and circulating cytokines may serve as readouts to differentiate between specific causes of ARDS. Here, we demonstrate that CXCL17 can be detected in post-mortem human lung specimens from patients with pandemic influenza A(H1N1) and COVID-19. Furthermore, serum levels of CXCL17 are differentially regulated during influenza and COVID-19, pointing to a possible diagnostic value for the chemokine. Importantly, we found that CXCL17 is not elevated in the serum of PTB patients neither. Although individuals with this disease rarely present with ARDS, the fact that only influenza but not PTB or COVID-19 patients showed high CXCL17 levels remarks the specific diagnostic potential of this chemokine during influenza.\nChemokines can be divided into homeostatic or inflammatory depending on their expression patterns ( 13 ). CXCL17 is considered a \"dual\" chemokine because it exhibits characteristics of both homeostatic and inflammatory chemokines. It is constitutively expressed in the mucosa of the respiratory tract with potential functions in lung defenses ( 14 ) and is known to chemoattract macrophages ( 4 ). This chemokine was the last member of the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand family to be reported ( 1 ), and as such, its role during respiratory inflammation or infections is not well understood. We should note that bioinformatics analyses of public gene expression databases indicate that CXCL17 is the highest expressed chemokine in the normal trachea and bronchus and among the highest expressed chemokines in the normal human lung ( 2 ). These observations strongly suggest important homeostatic functions for CXCL17 in the respiratory tract. Previous studies have shown that CXCL17 is strongly upregulated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( 2 ). This, along with data from our current study indicates that CXCL17 is very likely to have important functions in the pathogenesis of inflammatory/infectious diseases of the lung as well. Past studies have provided indirect evidence about a possible role of CXCL17 in immunity against respiratory infections. For instance, it has been shown that CXCL17 has a potent bactericidal activity over bacteria causative of respiratory infections ( 2 ). The expression of the  CXCL17  gene was also found upregulated in group 3 innate lymphoid cells isolated from lung tissues of patients with tuberculosis (TB) ( 15 ), suggesting a role for CXCL17 against  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Mtb) infection. However, CXCL17 plays redundant activities during anti-Mtb immunity in murine models ( 16 ). In this context, our study represents the first direct evaluation of the expression of CXCL17 during respiratory infections in humans.\nOur analyses of lung autopsy specimens suggest that the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus and SARS-CoV-2 stimulate the local production of CXCL17 in the pulmonary tissue. Indeed, although these findings were made only in two patients who died of influenza and two with COVID-19, the pattern of expression observed during both infections differ from what it is observed at steady state. In this regard, using non-infected human lung specimens, we previously demonstrated that CXCL17 is detected only at the luminal surface of alveolar epithelial cells ( 2 ). Conversely, here we found that lungs infected with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 express CXCL17 in the whole cytoplasm of pneumocytes, as well as in infiltrating macrophages. This is further supported by a recent paper demonstrating a high induction of CXCL17 in the BAL of COVID-19 ( 17 ). However, we found that the magnitude of CXCL17 expression in the serum was also robust during influenza but minimal in COVID-19 patients. These are contrasting observations, although we must consider that the lung tissue specimens in our study were obtained post-mortem. Therefore, our immunohistochemical analysis evaluated the expression of CXCL17 only during the latest phases of viral infection, whereas serum chemokine determinations captured early responses against COVID-19 and influenza. Analysis of CXCL17 expression in lung biopsy specimens obtained early during the infection would have clarified this point. Despite this, we speculate that lung and serum CXCL17 levels may increase as the infection with SARS-CoV-2 progresses in patients with severe disease. Whether longitudinal changes in serum CXCL17 levels could have a prognostic value in COVID-19 should be investigated in future studies.\nOur findings may be also explained by possible different abilities of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 virus strains to induce local CXCL17 production and translocation to the blood according to their virulence. Indeed, previous research showed that the infection of human bronchial epithelial cells, human tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and human alveolar A549 cells with seasonal influenza A(H3N2) virus, promotes robust upregulation of  CXCL17 . However, the infection with more virulent A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) influenza virus subtypes induces minor changes in the expression of  CXCL17  ( 18 ). Similarly, in a yet unpublished experiment available from the Influenza Research Database (IRD), the infection of 2B-4cells/sorted Calu-3 cells with a wild type strain of the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV (icSARS CoV) did not stimulate strong expression of  CXCL17  ( 19 ). In contrast, the infection with icSARS ExoNI and icSARS dNSP16, which are attenuated mutant strains of SARS-CoV, upregulated the expression of  CXCL17 .\nNotably, we also demonstrated that these differences could be harnessed for clinical applications, as serum CXCL17 levels determined at hospital admission are useful to distinguish between influenza and COVID-19 in patients with ARDS. This is important, especially at settings of high circulation of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus strains, as it is highly likely that both diseases will converge during the upcoming flu season. During such a predicted scenario, the differentiation of influenza and COVID-19 by clinical characteristics may be complicated. Indeed, our results and previous studies show that only a few non-specific symptoms and routine laboratory tests are useful for this diagnostic dilemma ( 20 - 22 ). However, the discrimination of the causative pathogen has direct therapeutic implications, including the selection of the adequate anti-viral drug. Thus, novel biomarkers with high diagnostic value to distinguish influenza and COVID-19 are urgently needed.\nAnother striking finding of our study is that serum levels of CXCL17 impact on pandemic influenza A(H1N1)-associated mortality. In this sense, it is known that several chemokines participate in the immune response against influenza viruses ( 23 ,  24 ). Most of them are produced in high amounts and mediate pathology due to their pro-inflammatory properties ( 25 ,  26 ). Our data indicate that the production of CXCL17 is also highly potentiated during the early stages of pandemic influenza A(H1N1), as the serum levels reported here are as high as those found in other inflammatory and human autoimmune disorders ( 2 ,  11 ). Moreover, we demonstrate that both macrophages and lung epithelial cells can become sources of CXCL17 after infection with the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus.\nCXCL17 normally mediates the recruitment of myeloid cells to the lung ( 4 ). Cell subtypes responding to this chemokine include DCs, monocytes, and macrophages ( 1 ,  4 ,  27 ). However, we should note that the nature of the myeloid cells recruited by CXCL17  in vivo  has not been established in humans, although the fact that CXCL17 is a mucosal chemokine expressed only in the respiratory and digestive tracts suggests that it is recruiting unique population(s) of myeloid cells to mucosal tissues which remain to be functionally characterized. Increased and sustained recruitment of myeloid cells to the lungs is associated with immunopathology and mortality in influenza ( 23 ,  24 ). Accordingly, our data indicate that influenza patients with higher CXCL17 levels have lower survival, suggesting a possible pathogenic role for this chemokine. We should also mention that CXCL17 also mediates anti-inflammatory activities ( 25 ,  26 ). Thus, our findings may reflect a regulatory mechanism for the cytokine storm underlying severe influenza,  via  the production of high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators.\nThe role of innate immune cells responding to CXCL17 in COVID-19 is unknown, but recent studies have found that the numbers of circulating DCs and monocytes are reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to patients with milder forms of the disease ( 28 ). In contrast, we found a high number of macrophages in the lung autopsy specimens of patients that died of COVID-19. Together, these data point to a possible role for chemokines involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells to the lungs during COVID-19, and CXCL17 is an excellent candidate to mediate this recruitment ( 4 ). However, whether CXCL17 plays a pathogenic or protective role during influenza or COVID-19 is not apparent from our data.\nA caveat of our study is that CXCL17 levels were assessed only in influenza patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not in individuals with milder forms of the disease nor in persons with seasonal influenza infections. Hence, future studies must validate our results in other cohorts of influenza patients. Also, we measured serum levels of CXCL17 in COVID-19 patients only at the time of hospital admission. Thus, the analysis of additional time points is required to draw conclusions on the prognostic role of this chemokine in COVID-19. Finally, our findings in PTB patients indicate that CXCL17 is not highly released from the lung to the serum during Mtb infection. This, along with previous results from our group ( 16 ), may indicate a minimal role for this chemokine during PTB. Nonetheless, more studies are necessary to rule out a contribution of CXCL17 to the immunity against Mtb.\n"], "ner": [[[26, 30, "DISEASE"], [104, 123, "DISEASE"], [464, 468, "DISEASE"], [496, 502, "GENE"], [583, 592, "DISEASE"], [605, 613, "DISEASE"], [644, 650, "GENE"], [655, 679, "RELATION"], [687, 696, "DISEASE"], [701, 709, "DISEASE"], [797, 803, "GENE"], [836, 839, "DISEASE"], [917, 921, "DISEASE"], [942, 951, "DISEASE"], [960, 963, "DISEASE"], [967, 975, "DISEASE"], [997, 1003, "GENE"], [1032, 1052, "RELATION"], [1078, 1087, "DISEASE"]], [[1195, 1201, "GENE"], [1773, 1779, "GENE"], [1997, 2003, "GENE"], [2063, 2069, "GENE"], [2073, 2093, "RELATION"], [2097, 2126, "DISEASE"], [2194, 2200, "GENE"], [2391, 2397, "GENE"], [2479, 2485, "GENE"], [2601, 2607, "GENE"], [2629, 2640, "RELATION"], [2718, 2730, "DISEASE"], [2732, 2734, "DISEASE"], [2766, 2772, "GENE"], [2836, 2842, "GENE"], [3007, 3013, "GENE"]], [[3111, 3120, "DISEASE"], [3190, 3196, "GENE"], [3297, 3306, "DISEASE"], [3320, 3328, "DISEASE"], [3526, 3532, "GENE"], [3660, 3669, "DISEASE"], [3693, 3699, "GENE"], [3839, 3853, "RELATION"], [3857, 3863, "GENE"], [3878, 3886, "DISEASE"], [3935, 3941, "GENE"], [3989, 3998, "DISEASE"], [4014, 4022, "DISEASE"], [4238, 4244, "GENE"], [4367, 4375, "DISEASE"], [4380, 4389, "DISEASE"], [4403, 4409, "GENE"], [4562, 4568, "GENE"], [4704, 4710, "GENE"], [4751, 4759, "DISEASE"]], [[4872, 4881, "DISEASE"], [4927, 4933, "GENE"], [5238, 5244, "GENE"], [5309, 5318, "DISEASE"], [5378, 5384, "GENE"], [5641, 5647, "GENE"], [5801, 5807, "GENE"]], [[5918, 5924, "GENE"], [5999, 6008, "DISEASE"], [6013, 6021, "DISEASE"], [6039, 6043, "DISEASE"], [6311, 6319, "DISEASE"], [6746, 6755, "DISEASE"], [6760, 6768, "DISEASE"]], [[6852, 6858, "GENE"], [6878, 6887, "DISEASE"], [7204, 7210, "GENE"], [7274, 7283, "DISEASE"], [7515, 7521, "GENE"]], [[7578, 7584, "GENE"], [7830, 7836, "GENE"], [7906, 7912, "GENE"], [8335, 8341, "GENE"], [8456, 8462, "GENE"], [8615, 8624, "DISEASE"]], [[8740, 8746, "GENE"], [8750, 8758, "DISEASE"], [9079, 9087, "DISEASE"], [9215, 9223, "DISEASE"], [9229, 9235, "GENE"], [9314, 9320, "GENE"], [9366, 9375, "DISEASE"], [9379, 9387, "DISEASE"]], [[9449, 9455, "GENE"], [9485, 9494, "DISEASE"], [9525, 9534, "DISEASE"], [9629, 9638, "DISEASE"], [9773, 9779, "GENE"], [9783, 9791, "DISEASE"], [9962, 9970, "DISEASE"], [9997, 10000, "DISEASE"], [10024, 10030, "GENE"], [10214, 10217, "DISEASE"], [10289, 10295, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[644, 650, 687, 696, "dysregulation"], [644, 650, 701, 709, "dysregulation"], [997, 1003, 1078, 1087, "diagnostic tool"]], [[2063, 2069, 2097, 2126, "increased expression"], [2601, 2607, 2718, 2730, "increased expression"], [2601, 2607, 2732, 2734, "increased expression"]], [[3857, 3863, 3878, 3886, "increased expression"]], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[[644, 650, 687, 696, 655, 679], [644, 650, 701, 709, 655, 679], [997, 1003, 1078, 1087, 1032, 1052]], [[2063, 2069, 2097, 2126, 2073, 2093], [2601, 2607, 2718, 2730, 2629, 2640], [2601, 2607, 2732, 2734, 2629, 2640]], [[3857, 3863, 3878, 3886, 3839, 3853]], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[["CXCL17", "influenza", "differentially regulated"], ["CXCL17", "COVID - 19", "differentially regulated"], ["CXCL17", "influenza", "diagnostic potential"]], [["CXCL17", "idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "strongly upregulated"], ["CXCL17", "tuberculosis", "upregulated"], ["CXCL17", "TB", "upregulated"]], [["CXCL17", "COVID - 19", "high induction"]], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], "sentences": ["\nThe clinical spectrum of ARDS encompasses very severe forms of the disease characterized by a profound respiratory failure.

Our data indicate that the production of CXCL17 is also highly potentiated during the early stages of pandemic influenza A(H1N1), as the serum levels reported here are as high as those found in other inflammatory and human autoimmune disorders ( 2 ,  11 ). Moreover, we demonstrate that both macrophages and lung epithelial cells can become sources of CXCL17 after infection with the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus.\n", "CXCL17 normally mediates the recruitment of myeloid cells to the lung ( 4 ). Cell subtypes responding to this chemokine include DCs, monocytes, and macrophages ( 1 ,  4 ,  27 ). However, we should note that the nature of the myeloid cells recruited by CXCL17  in vivo  has not been established in humans, although the fact that CXCL17 is a mucosal chemokine expressed only in the respiratory and digestive tracts suggests that it is recruiting unique population(s) of myeloid cells to mucosal tissues which remain to be functionally characterized. Increased and sustained recruitment of myeloid cells to the lungs is associated with immunopathology and mortality in influenza ( 23 ,  24 ). Accordingly, our data indicate that influenza patients with higher CXCL17 levels have lower survival, suggesting a possible pathogenic role for this chemokine. We should also mention that CXCL17 also mediates anti-inflammatory activities ( 25 ,  26 ). Thus, our findings may reflect a regulatory mechanism for the cytokine storm underlying severe influenza,  via  the production of high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators.\n", "The role of innate immune cells responding to CXCL17 in COVID-19 is unknown, but recent studies have found that the numbers of circulating DCs and monocytes are reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to patients with milder forms of the disease ( 28 ). In contrast, we found a high number of macrophages in the lung autopsy specimens of patients that died of COVID-19. Together, these data point to a possible role for chemokines involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells to the lungs during COVID-19, and CXCL17 is an excellent candidate to mediate this recruitment ( 4 ). However, whether CXCL17 plays a pathogenic or protective role during influenza or COVID-19 is not apparent from our data.\n", "A caveat of our study is that CXCL17 levels were assessed only in influenza patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1), but not in individuals with milder forms of the disease nor in persons with seasonal influenza infections. Hence, future studies must validate our results in other cohorts of influenza patients. Also, we measured serum levels of CXCL17 in COVID-19 patients only at the time of hospital admission. Thus, the analysis of additional time points is required to draw conclusions on the prognostic role of this chemokine in COVID-19. Finally, our findings in PTB patients indicate that CXCL17 is not highly released from the lung to the serum during Mtb infection. This, along with previous results from our group ( 16 ), may indicate a minimal role for this chemokine during PTB. Nonetheless, more studies are necessary to rule out a contribution of CXCL17 to the immunity against Mtb.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "7953906_Introduction", "text": ["\nThe C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CXCL17) is a mucosal chemokine expressed in the respiratory tract under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions ( 1 - 3 ). Its homeostatic functions include the recruitment of various myeloid cell populations [dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages] to mucosal tissues, including the lung ( 4 ). Under inflammatory conditions, its functions are less well characterized, although it has been reported to promote anti-inflammatory activities and likely prevent autoimmunity ( 2 ,  4 ). CXCL17 also exhibits broad antimicrobial activity ( 2 ,  4 ), suggesting that it may play an important role in protective immunity against respiratory pathogens. In viral infections, there is only a report suggesting that CXCL17 participates in immunity against genitourinary herpes infections ( 5 ). However, despite CXCL17 being one of the most highly expressed chemokines in the human lung, its potential role in human respiratory infections has not been studied.\nHere, we report high levels of CXCL17 in serum from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with pandemic influenza A(H1N1). Conversely, serum CXCL17 levels in severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) were not elevated, indicating that CXCL17 serum levels are a specific diagnostic marker that differentiate pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from other infections in patients with respiratory illness. We also analyzed the pattern of expression of this chemokine in lung specimens from patients with influenza and COVID-19. Importantly, analyses of CXCL17 serum levels in influenza A (H1N1) patients revealed that high levels of CXCL17 correlated with poor prognosis, including kidney injury and death. Finally, we identified that human alveolar A549 cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages produce CXCL17 after an  in vitro  exposure to the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus.\nOur data might be helpful for the clinical decision-making process during the ongoing flu season, which is projected to be one of the most challenging public health crises in recent history due to the convergence of influenza and COVID-19. Moreover, our results for the first time indicate that CXCL17 might have a prognostic value during severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1). Overall, these preliminary data justify future efforts to address a possible role for CXCL17 during influenza.

This chemokine is constitutively expressed in the respiratory tract, suggesting a role in lung defenses. However, little is known about the participation of CXCL17 against relevant respiratory pathogens in humans. Here, we evaluated the serum levels and lung tissue expression pattern of CXCL17 in a cohort of patients with severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) from Mexico City. Peripheral blood samples obtained on admission and seven days after hospitalization were processed for determinations of serum CXCL17 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of CXCL17 was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHQ) in lung autopsy specimens from patients that succumbed to the disease. Serum CXCL17 levels were also analyzed in two additional comparative cohorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients. Additionally, the expression of CXCL17 was tested in lung autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients. A total of 122 patients were enrolled in the study, from which 68 had pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 24 had COVID-19, and 30 with PTB.

NR4A2 is overexpressed in synovium and cartilage from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, and osteoarthritis. This study documents the expression and tissue localization of NR4A2 and upstream regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in the human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (hTNF-\u03b1) transgenic mouse model of RA. Since TNF-\u03b1 is a potent inducer of NR4A2  in vitro , we hypothesized that NR4A2 would also be upregulated and active during disease progression in this model. Expression levels of NR4A2, related receptors NR4A1 (Nur77) and 3 (NOR1), and NF-\u03baB 1  transcripts were quantified by RT-qPCR in hTNF-\u03b1 and wild-type joints at three stages of disease. The protein distribution of NR4A2 and NF-\u03baB subunit RelA (p65) was analyzed by quantitative immunohistochemistry. Global gene expression of 88 RA-related genes was also screened and compared between groups. Consistent with previous reports on the hTNF-\u03b1 model, transgenic mice exhibited significant weight loss and severely swollen paws by 19 weeks of age compared to age-matched wild-type controls. NR4A1-3 and NF-\u03baB 1  were constitutively expressed at disease onset and in healthy joints. NF-\u03baB 1  transcript levels increased 2-fold in hTNF-\u03b1 paws with established disease (12 weeks), followed by a 2-fold increase in NR4A2 at the late disease stage (19 weeks). NR4A2 and RelA proteins were overexpressed in inflamed synovium prior to symptoms of arthritis, suggesting that gene expression changes documented in whole paws were largely driven by elevated expression in diseased synovium.

NR4A2 is overexpressed in synovium and cartilage from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, and osteoarthritis. This study documents the expression and tissue localization of NR4A2 and upstream regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in the human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (hTNF-\u03b1) transgenic mouse model of RA. Since TNF-\u03b1 is a potent inducer of NR4A2  in vitro , we hypothesized that NR4A2 would also be upregulated and active during disease progression in this model. Expression levels of NR4A2, related receptors NR4A1 (Nur77) and 3 (NOR1), and NF-\u03baB 1  transcripts were quantified by RT-qPCR in hTNF-\u03b1 and wild-type joints at three stages of disease. The protein distribution of NR4A2 and NF-\u03baB subunit RelA (p65) was analyzed by quantitative immunohistochemistry. Global gene expression of 88 RA-related genes was also screened and compared between groups. Consistent with previous reports on the hTNF-\u03b1 model, transgenic mice exhibited significant weight loss and severely swollen paws by 19 weeks of age compared to age-matched wild-type controls. NR4A1-3 and NF-\u03baB 1  were constitutively expressed at disease onset and in healthy joints. NF-\u03baB 1  transcript levels increased 2-fold in hTNF-\u03b1 paws with established disease (12 weeks), followed by a 2-fold increase in NR4A2 at the late disease stage (19 weeks). NR4A2 and RelA proteins were overexpressed in inflamed synovium prior to symptoms of arthritis, suggesting that gene expression changes documented in whole paws were largely driven by elevated expression in diseased synovium. Broader screening of RA-related genes by RT-qPCR identified several differentially expressed genes in hTNF-\u03b1 joints including those encoding inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, matrix-degrading enzymes and inhibitors, cell surface receptors, intracellular signaling proteins and transcription factors. Consensus binding sites for NR4A receptors and NF-\u03baB 1  were enriched in the promoters of differentially expressed genes suggesting central roles for these transcription factors in this model.

The hTNF-\u03b1 model was generated using a 2.8 kb transgene containing the human TNF-\u03b1 gene with the full-length promoter and coding region. The endogenous 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the human TNF-\u03b1 gene was replaced with the human beta-globin 3' UTR which served to stabilize the transcript ( Keffer et al., 1991 ). The transgenic line was produced by pronuclear microinjection of B6SLJ (F2) hybrid zygotes and mice were backcrossed for over 20 generations onto the C57BL6/N genetic background. For this study, transgenic and wild-type littermates were maintained at Taconic Biosciences until 8 ( n  = 5), 12 ( n  = 4), and 19 weeks of age ( n  = 4), representing early, established, and late stages of RA ( Taconic Biosciences, 2022 ). Mice were group-housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light cycle and access to food and water ad libitum. At the end of the study, body mass was measured and clinical scores were assessed by Taconic Biosciences using a 24-point scoring system as follows: 20 digits scored as 0 (normal) or 0.2 (one or more swollen joints) for a maximum total digit score of 4, each paw scored as 0 (normal), 1 (noticeably swollen) or 2 (severely swollen) for a maximum total paw score of 8, each wrist scored as 0 (normal), 1 (noticeably swollen), or 2 (severely swollen) for a maximum total wrist score of 4 and each ankle scored as 0 (normal), 2 (noticeably swollen), or 4 (severely swollen) for a maximum total ankle score of 8 ( Taconic Biosciences, 2022 ). Immediately after euthanasia, paws were dissected proximal to the ankle/wrist joints and transferred to RNAlater (left paws) and 10% neutral buffered formalin (right paws) for RT-qPCR and histology, respectively. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Taconic Biosciences and Loyola University New Orleans.\nImmunohistochemistry and Imaging\nHind paws ( n  = 13 per genotype) were fixed in neutral-buffered formalin followed by decalcification with formic acid-based Decalcifier I (Leica), paraffin processed and embedded sagittally for microtomy. Serial 5 \u00b5m-thick sections were cut and mounted on Trubond 380 slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Slides were then heated for 45 min at 59\u00b0C, deparaffinized, re-hydrated, and formaldehyde cross-links were dissociated by submerging slides in pressure-heated citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidases were removed by treatment with 3% H 2 O 2  in methanol and non-specific binding was reduced by incubation in Protein Block (Abcam). Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either rabbit polyclonal anti-NR4A2 (Novus NB110-40415), rabbit monoclonal anti-RelA (Abcam ab32536), rabbit IgG isotype control (Abcam 172730) or antibody diluent only. After washing, sections were incubated for 30 min in anti-rabbit Ig (H + L) secondary conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Vector ImPRESS). The reaction product of Diaminobenzidine and H 2 O 2  was used as substrate to visualize the tagged epitopes. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and images collected with an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a digital camera driven by CellSens software (Olympus). Semi-quantitative scoring of RelA and NR4A2-positive cells in synovium and cartilage from at least two 400\u00d7 fields per section was conducted by two blinded observers. Representative images from hTNF-\u03b1 and wild-type joints at 400\u00d7 magnification are shown.\nRNA Extraction and RT-qPCR\nContralateral paws were dissected proximal to the ankle/wrist joints and the skin was removed. Tissue was coarsely minced with a scalpel and homogenized with a TissueTearor (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ, United States). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy fibrous tissue mini columns (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, United States), eluted into RNase-free water and quantified with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the iSCRIPT reverse transcriptase master mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Twenty microliter reactions were prepared with 1 \u00b5g of total RNA from each paw (50 ng/\u00b5l cDNA). Control reactions were prepared with the negative control master mix provided with the kit. Reactions were incubated in a Bio-Rad C1000 thermocycler for 5 min at 25\u00b0C, 30 min at 42\u00b0C, and 5 min at 85\u00b0C. Quantitative PCR was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and validated primers spanning exon-intron junctions in the mouse TATA-Box Binding Protein (TBP), NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, and NF-\u03baB 1  genes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Twenty microliter reactions were prepared in triplicate with 50 ng of cDNA from each sample and incubated in a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) for 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 5 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 60\u00b0C (40 cycles), followed by melting curve analysis from 65\u00b0C-95\u00b0C using CFX Manager Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Relative gene expression was calculated by the 2 -DeltaDeltaCt  method ( Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ) with target gene levels normalized to TBP.\nRT-qPCR Panels and Promoter Analysis\nPre-designed PrimePCR panels were used to analyze 88 mouse genes associated with RA and reference genes (Rheumatoid Arthritis Tier 1 M96, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States). Pooled cDNA from transgenic or wild-type paws ( n  = 4/group) at early or late time points was mixed with iTaq Universal SYBR Green SuperMix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and added to each well of the PrimePCR reaction plates containing lyophilized primers. Reactions were incubated for 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 5 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 60\u00b0C (40 cycles), followed by melting curve analysis from 65\u00b0C-95\u00b0C. Target gene expression was normalized to TBP and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using the gene study analysis in the CFX Manager Software. Control assays included on each PrimePCR plate confirmed RNA integrity and the absence of contaminating genomic DNA. Thresholds for induced and repressed genes in hTNF-\u03b1 mice were set at a >2-fold increase or a >0.5-fold decrease, respectively. Genes were classified as stable if fold-change values were between these thresholds. LASAGNA (Length-Aware Site Alignment Guided by Nucleotide Association)-Search, an integrated web tool for predicting transcription factor binding sites with the LASAGNA algorithm, was used to analyze gene promoters in all expressed genes ( Lee and Huang, 2013 ). Promoter regions of mouse genes (-1,000 bp to 0) were scanned for NR4A2 (AAGGTCAC) and NF-\u03baB 1  (GGGGATTCCCC) binding sites using matrix derived JASPAR CORE models of consensus vertebrate binding sites, with a  p -value threshold of <0.001.\nStatistical Analysis\nGraphPad Prism software (version 9.3.1) was used to generate graphs and compare gene and protein expression data between groups of age-matched transgenic and wild-type mice.

{"doc_key": "9067626_Introduction", "text": ["\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy with an estimated global population prevalence of 0.46% ( Almutairi et al., 2021 ). RA is characterized by synovial membrane hyperplasia, leukocyte infiltration, and irreversible cartilage and bone destruction in multiple joints. Biological therapies targeting the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) serve as robust treatment options for attenuating chronic inflammation in RA ( Mitoma et al., 2018 ;  Kerschbaumer et al., 2020 ). However, these agents are expensive and 30%-40% of RA patients have inadequate clinical responses ( Rubbert-Roth et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, blocking TNF-\u03b1 results in broad-spectrum immunosuppression that increases the risk of serious infections and some types of cancer ( Sartori et al., 2019 ;  Sepriano et al., 2020 ;  Li et al., 2021 ). Elucidating molecular pathways downstream of TNF-\u03b1 may lead to the development of more selective drugs capable of attenuating joint damage without compromising essential immune functions.\nThe orphan nuclear receptor 4A2 (NR4A2/Nurr1) may be a promising therapeutic target downstream of TNF-\u03b1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways. \u03a4his transcription factor is a member of the NR4A family of receptors along with NR4A1 (Nur77) and NR4A3 (NOR1). The NR4A receptors share a high degree of homology and may have functional redundancy in some cellular contexts ( Crean and Murphy, 2021 ). In contrast to other nuclear receptors, the NR4A receptors are presumed to be constitutively active, ligand-independent factors regulated at the level of expression and post-translational modification ( Zhao and Bruemmer, 2010 ). In response to inflammation, NF-\u03baB and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) bind directly to the NR4A2 promoter and rapidly induce its expression in chondrocytes, synoviocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells ( McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Pei et al., 2006 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ). NR4A2 is also highly expressed in inflamed synovial tissues from individuals with RA and psoriatic arthritis as well as in cartilage from individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) ( Murphy et al., 2001 ;  McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Ralph et al., 2010 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ). Over-expression of NR4A2 in synovial fibroblasts enhances proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion, suggesting critical roles for this receptor in synovial hyperplasia ( Mix et al., 2012 ) .  At the transcriptional level, NR4A2 regulates expression of the chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), cartilage-degrading matrix metalloproteinases-1 and 13 (MMP-1, 13), and the immunomodulatory peptide hormone prolactin ( Davies et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ;  McCoy et al., 2015 ). While analyses of human joint tissues and cells have yielded important insight into NR4A2-dependent mechanisms, a comprehensive analysis of receptor mRNA expression levels and protein distribution has not been performed in an animal model of arthritis.\nThis study provides a detailed analysis of gene expression levels and joint tissue distribution patterns of the NR4A receptors and NF-\u03baB in a transgenic mouse model of RA driven by chronic expression of the human TNF-\u03b1 cytokine (hTNF-\u03b1, Taconic model 1006). Transgenic models expressing hTNF-\u03b1 have demonstrated great utility for pre-clinical validation of therapies and insight into RA mechanisms ( Douni et al., 2004 ;  Zwerina et al., 2004 ;  Delavall\u00e9e et al., 2009 ;  Binder et al., 2013 ;  Li et al., 2016 ;  Karagianni et al., 2019 ;  Ubah et al., 2019 ). The hTNF-\u03b1 transgenic mice studied here exhibit spontaneous and progressive inflammation leading to severe polyarthritis by 20 weeks of age. Since TNF-\u03b1 is a potent inducer of NF-\u03baB and NR4A2 in human joint cells, we hypothesized that these transcription factors would also be upregulated and active during disease progression in the hTNF-\u03b1 model.

RA is characterized by synovial membrane hyperplasia, leukocyte infiltration, and irreversible cartilage and bone destruction in multiple joints. Biological therapies targeting the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) serve as robust treatment options for attenuating chronic inflammation in RA ( Mitoma et al., 2018 ;  Kerschbaumer et al., 2020 ). However, these agents are expensive and 30%-40% of RA patients have inadequate clinical responses ( Rubbert-Roth et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, blocking TNF-\u03b1 results in broad-spectrum immunosuppression that increases the risk of serious infections and some types of cancer ( Sartori et al., 2019 ;  Sepriano et al., 2020 ;  Li et al., 2021 ). Elucidating molecular pathways downstream of TNF-\u03b1 may lead to the development of more selective drugs capable of attenuating joint damage without compromising essential immune functions.\n", "The orphan nuclear receptor 4A2 (NR4A2/Nurr1) may be a promising therapeutic target downstream of TNF-\u03b1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways. \u03a4his transcription factor is a member of the NR4A family of receptors along with NR4A1 (Nur77) and NR4A3 (NOR1). The NR4A receptors share a high degree of homology and may have functional redundancy in some cellular contexts ( Crean and Murphy, 2021 ). In contrast to other nuclear receptors, the NR4A receptors are presumed to be constitutively active, ligand-independent factors regulated at the level of expression and post-translational modification ( Zhao and Bruemmer, 2010 ). In response to inflammation, NF-\u03baB and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) bind directly to the NR4A2 promoter and rapidly induce its expression in chondrocytes, synoviocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells ( McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Pei et al., 2006 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ). NR4A2 is also highly expressed in inflamed synovial tissues from individuals with RA and psoriatic arthritis as well as in cartilage from individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) ( Murphy et al., 2001 ;  McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Ralph et al., 2010 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ). Over-expression of NR4A2 in synovial fibroblasts enhances proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion, suggesting critical roles for this receptor in synovial hyperplasia ( Mix et al., 2012 ) .  At the transcriptional level, NR4A2 regulates expression of the chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8), cartilage-degrading matrix metalloproteinases-1 and 13 (MMP-1, 13), and the immunomodulatory peptide hormone prolactin ( Davies et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ;  McCoy et al., 2015 ). While analyses of human joint tissues and cells have yielded important insight into NR4A2-dependent mechanisms, a comprehensive analysis of receptor mRNA expression levels and protein distribution has not been performed in an animal model of arthritis.\n", "This study provides a detailed analysis of gene expression levels and joint tissue distribution patterns of the NR4A receptors and NF-\u03baB in a transgenic mouse model of RA driven by chronic expression of the human TNF-\u03b1 cytokine (hTNF-\u03b1, Taconic model 1006). Transgenic models expressing hTNF-\u03b1 have demonstrated great utility for pre-clinical validation of therapies and insight into RA mechanisms ( Douni et al., 2004 ;  Zwerina et al., 2004 ;  Delavall\u00e9e et al., 2009 ;  Binder et al., 2013 ;  Li et al., 2016 ;  Karagianni et al., 2019 ;  Ubah et al., 2019 ). The hTNF-\u03b1 transgenic mice studied here exhibit spontaneous and progressive inflammation leading to severe polyarthritis by 20 weeks of age. Since TNF-\u03b1 is a potent inducer of NF-\u03baB and NR4A2 in human joint cells, we hypothesized that these transcription factors would also be upregulated and active during disease progression in the hTNF-\u03b1 model. To test this, we quantified NR4A1-3 and NF-\u03baB mRNA levels by RT-qPCR and measured protein distribution by immunohistochemistry in joints from hTNF-\u03b1 mice at different disease stages. In addition, a broader screen of RA-related genes was conducted and potential NR4A and NF-\u03baB target genes were identified through promoter analyses. Our results provide the first spatiotemporal map of NR4A2 distribution in an animal model of RA and validate the hTNF-\u03b1 model for testing of small molecules and genetic therapies targeting this transcription factor.\n"]}
{"doc_key": "9067626_Results", "text": ["\nSymptoms and physical signs of arthritis were monitored in hTNF-\u03b1 transgenic mice at early (8 weeks), established (12 weeks), and late (19 weeks) disease stages. Transgenic mice appeared healthy at 8 weeks of age but demonstrated impaired mobility and reduced digit splaying by 12 weeks. Severe polyarthritis was evident in all transgenic mice by 19 weeks and elevated clinical scores reflected severely swollen digits, paws, and ankle joints ( Figure 1A ). Consistent with previous studies in this model ( Taconic Biosciences, 2022 ), synovial hyperplasia, leukocyte infiltration, cartilage destruction, fibrosis, and subchondral bone erosion were observed in digit and ankle joints (data not shown). Furthermore, hTNF-\u03b1 mice demonstrated a significant decrease in body mass at 12 and 19 weeks ( Figure 1B ,  p  < 0.05), consistent with RA-induced cachexia. In contrast, wild-type mice remained healthy and demonstrated a steady increase in body mass.\nTo investigate transcriptional pathways activated by hTNF-\u03b1 signaling in this model, NF-\u03baB and orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1-3 mRNA levels were measured in whole paws from transgenic and wild-type mice by RT-qPCR. NF-\u03baB 1  mRNA was expressed at similar levels between transgenic and wild-type groups at 8 weeks and increased 2-fold at established and late disease stages ( Figure 2A ,  p  < 0.05). All three NR4A receptors were detected without differential expression at 8 and 12 weeks ( Figures 2B-D ). At the late disease stage, NR4A2 was selectively upregulated 2-fold ( Figure 2C ,  p  < 0.05), while NR4A1 and 3 remained equivalent to wild-type levels. These gene expression results reflect the net expression patterns of NF-\u03baB 1  and the NR4A receptors in whole paws composed of multiple tissues and cell types.\nTo expand on these findings and measure the histological distribution of NF-\u03baB and NR4A2 proteins, sections of contralateral paws from hTNF-\u03b1 and wild-type mice were assayed by immunohistochemistry. RelA was detected in chondrocytes from wild-type and hTNF-\u03b1 joints ( Figures 3A,D,E,F ). At the early stage of disease, 80% of hTNF-\u03b1 chondrocytes in the resting zone of the articular surfaces stained positive for RelA ( Figure 3I ,  p  < 0.005). However, at the established and late disease stages, RelA positivity in cartilage decreased to wild-type levels without significant differences between groups  Figures 3E,F,I . Synovial hyperplasia was observed with concurrent increases in RelA signal in synoviocytes ( Figures 3B,H , >70%,  p  < 0.005) and cells in synovio-entheseal compartments ( Figure 3C ). Isotype controls confirmed the absence of background staining on paw sections ( Figure 3G ).\nNR4A2 was detected in a similar distribution pattern in both cartilage and synovium and ubiquitously expressed in superficial chondrocytes from hTNF-\u03b1 and wild-type joints at the early timepoint ( Figures 4A,D,I ). A 10% decrease in NR4A2 positive chondrocytes was observed in both groups at late stage, but statistical significance was limited to the hTNF-\u03b1 groups ( Figure 4E,F,I ,  p  < 0.05). Synovial hyperplasia coincided with increases in NR4A2 in the synovium (>80%) and abundant expression in synoviocytes at the sites of membrane insertion to the cartilage ( Figures 4B,C,H ,  p  < 0.0005). Isotype controls confirmed the absence of background staining on paw sections ( Figure 4G ). Taken together, elevated RelA and NR4A2 protein levels in synoviocytes suggest that gene expression changes noted in whole paws ( Figure 2 ) are largely driven by disease changes in the synovium.\nTo further investigate arthritis-related molecular mechanisms in the hTNF-\u03b1 model, global gene expression patterns were examined in paws using RT-qPCR panels specific for 88 genes implicated in RA. A set of 48 genes was upregulated at the early stage of disease relative to wild-type controls, of which 22 remained elevated at the late stage along with nine additional induced genes ( Figures 5A,C,E ). Upregulated genes included inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-1, IL-4, CCL5, CXCL10, CXCL12), matrix degrading enzymes and inhibitors (MMP2, MMP9, TIMP1, TIMP2), cell surface receptors (ICAM1, VCAM1, CD14, CCR5, CXCR4, KDR), intracellular signaling proteins (AKT3, SOCS3, PRKCB, S100A4) and transcription factors (JUN, HIF1-alpha, STAT1, PPAR-alpha, CREB1). Endogenous mouse TNF-\u03b1 was elevated by 3.5-fold ( Figure 5C ), consistent with autoregulation of this cytokine in response to chronic hTNF-\u03b1 signaling. Validating RT-qPCR results presented earlier, NR4A2 (+4.4-fold) and NF-\u03baB transcripts (NFKB1 +11.8-fold, RELA +2.9-fold) were also upregulated in hTNF-\u03b1 paws ( Figures 5A,C ). Notably, four genes were repressed at the early stage (BCL2, MUC1, PTGS2, SLC16A3) and two were repressed at the late stage (UBC, IL-4) ( Figures 5B,D ). Differential expression was not observed for the remaining genes detected on the panels (early = 28, late = 51,  Supplementary Table S1 ).\nNext, the promoters of all genes detected in the panel experiment were scanned for putative binding sites for NF-\u03baB 1  (GGGGATTCCCC) and NR4A receptors (AAGGTCAC) using matrix derived JASPAR CORE models of consensus vertebrate binding sites ( Lee and Huang, 2013 ). Consensus binding sites for these factors were enriched in the promoters of differentially expressed genes relative to the stably expressed groups ( Table 1 ). Over half of the early induced promoters contained at least one NR4A or NF-\u03baB 1  binding site and 38% of the promoters contained sites for both factors. Furthermore, NR4A consensus binding sites were predicted in 8 of the 10 most highly induced promoters (CCL5, ICAM1, CD14, TNFRSF1B, NF\u03baB 1 , H2-AB1, TNFAIP3, TNFRSF1A) ( Supplementary Table S2 ). These trends were evident in differentially expressed genes from early and late stages of disease, suggesting that NF-\u03baB and NR4A receptors regulate transcriptional pathways central to this model.\n"], "ner": [[[61, 66, "GENE"], [717, 722, "GENE"], [839, 841, "DISEASE"]], [[1008, 1013, "GENE"], [1039, 1044, "GENE"], [1073, 1078, "GENE"], [1168, 1175, "GENE"], [1486, 1491, "GENE"], [1560, 1565, "GENE"], [1682, 1689, "GENE"]], [[1846, 1851, "GENE"], [1856, 1861, "GENE"], [1909, 1914, "GENE"], [1972, 1976, "GENE"], [2026, 2031, "GENE"], [2100, 2105, "GENE"], [2186, 2190, "GENE"], [2272, 2276, "GENE"], [2459, 2463, "GENE"]], [[2675, 2680, "GENE"], [2820, 2825, "GENE"], [2908, 2913, "GENE"], [3028, 3033, "GENE"], [3121, 3126, "GENE"], [3394, 3398, "GENE"], [3403, 3408, "GENE"]], [[3635, 3640, "GENE"], [4034, 4042, "GENE"], [4044, 4048, "GENE"], [4050, 4054, "GENE"], [4056, 4060, "GENE"], [4062, 4066, "GENE"], [4068, 4074, "GENE"], [4076, 4082, "GENE"], [4126, 4130, "GENE"], [4132, 4136, "GENE"], [4138, 4143, "GENE"], [4145, 4150, "GENE"], [4177, 4182, "GENE"], [4184, 4189, "GENE"], [4191, 4195, "GENE"], [4197, 4201, "GENE"], [4203, 4208, "GENE"], [4210, 4213, "GENE"], [4250, 4254, "GENE"], [4256, 4261, "GENE"], [4263, 4268, "GENE"], [4270, 4276, "GENE"], [4305, 4308, "GENE"], [4310, 4320, "GENE"], [4322, 4327, "GENE"], [4329, 4339, "GENE"], [4341, 4346, "GENE"], [4366, 4371, "GENE"], [4484, 4489, "GENE"], [4547, 4552, "GENE"], [4569, 4574, "GENE"], [4588, 4593, "GENE"], [4606, 4610, "GENE"], [4648, 4653, "GENE"], [4732, 4736, "GENE"], [4738, 4742, "GENE"], [4744, 4749, "GENE"], [4751, 4758, "GENE"], [4802, 4805, "GENE"]], [[5080, 5087, "GENE"], [5468, 5475, "GENE"], [5652, 5656, "GENE"], [5658, 5663, "GENE"], [5665, 5669, "GENE"], [5671, 5679, "GENE"], [5681, 5687, "GENE"], [5690, 5696, "GENE"], [5698, 5705, "GENE"], [5707, 5715, "GENE"], [5860, 5865, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "sentences": ["\nSymptoms and physical signs of arthritis were monitored in hTNF-\u03b1 transgenic mice at early (8 weeks), established (12 weeks), and late (19 weeks) disease stages.

{"doc_key": "9067626_Discussion Rev", "text": ["\nThis study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the NR4A receptors and NF-\u03baB in a transgenic mouse model of RA driven by the human TNF-\u03b1 cytokine. Since TNF-\u03b1 is a potent inducer of NF-\u03baB and NR4A receptors in human joint cells, we hypothesized that these transcription factors would also be expressed in arthritic joints  in vivo . NF-\u03baB 1  and NR4A2 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in whole paws from hTNF-\u03b1 mice, while NR4A1 and NR4A3 were not differentially expressed ( Figure 2 ). Consistent with transcriptional induction of NR4A2 by NF-\u03baB in human joint cells ( McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ), we documented an increase in NF-\u03baB 1  mRNA prior to NR4A2 upregulation at the late disease stage. Furthermore, we detected potent increases in RelA and NR4A2 proteins in inflamed synovium by immunohistochemistry ( Figures 3 ,  4 ), suggesting that gene expression patterns in whole paws are largely driven by changes in the synovium. In contrast, NR4A2 was constitutively expressed in the resting zone of cartilage but decreased at the late stage of disease. Since NR4A2 is a constitutively active transcription factor tightly regulated at the level of expression, the detection of NR4A2 protein in articular surfaces and synovium suggests this receptor is transcriptionally active in resident chondrocytes and synoviocytes.\nOur results in the hTNF-\u03b1 model are consistent with tissue-specific activities for the NR4A receptors in joints. In human synovial fibroblasts, NR4A2 exacerbates inflammation and tissue degradation by upregulating IL-8, MMP-13, prolactin, CRH, and CRH-receptor1 ( Murphy et al., 2001 ;  Davies et al., 2005 ;  Ralph et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ;  McCoy et al., 2015 ). In human chondrocytes, NR4A2 antagonizes MMP-1, 3, and 9 gene expression and contributes to chondroprotection ( Mix et al., 2007 ). However, depletion of NR4A1-3 in human chondrocytes antagonizes histamine-dependent regulation of RANKL expression, providing evidence for differential modulation of genes involved in cartilage degradation ( Marzaioli et al., 2012 ). In addition, studies in rat chondrocytes support a protective function for NR4A1 through suppression of COX-2, iNOS, and MMP expression ( Xiong et al., 2020 ), while other studies suggest that NR4A3 has opposing effects ( Ma et al., 2020 ).\nBy screening a broader panel of genes implicated in RA, we generated evidence of increased expression of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, matrix degrading enzymes and inhibitors, cell surface receptors, intracellular signaling proteins and transcription factors that support the hTNF-\u03b1 mouse as a model of RA ( Figure 5 ). Of these, IL-1beta and CCL5 were the most potently induced genes, consistent with the known activation of these promoters in response to increased TNF-\u03b1 signaling ( Turner et al., 1989 ;  Lee et al., 2000 ). Additionally, NR4A2, NF-\u03baB 1 , and RelA were also upregulated concurrent with increases in endogenous murine TNF-\u03b1. This screen focused on a select group of genes involved in RA and as such our results do not reflect the full spectrum of aberrant gene expression changes that may be occurring within hTNF-\u03b1 joints.\nPromoter analysis of differentially expressed genes supports central roles for NF-\u03baB and NR4A transcription factors in the hTNF-\u03b1 model. Consensus binding sites for NF-\u03baB 1  were predicted in the promoters of 58% of the induced genes in contrast to only 36% of the stable genes ( Table 1 ). Several of these differentially expressed genes have been previously recognized as transcriptional targets of NF-\u03baB. NR4A monomeric binding sites known as Nurr binding response elements (NBRE: AAACCGTA) were also enriched in the promoters of differentially expressed genes. Among the genes containing these promoter elements ( Supplementary Table S2 ), NR4A receptors have been reported to regulate BCL-2, IL-6, CXCL-12, CXCR-4, and MMP-9 in various cellular contexts ( Johnson et al., 2011 ,  Bonta et al., 2006 ,  Mix et al., 2007 ,  Duren et al., 2016 ). NR4A receptors can also modulate gene expression through heterodimeric binding with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and interactions with NF-\u03baB and erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) transcription factors ( Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Saijo et al., 2009 ;  Duren et al., 2016 ;  McEvoy et al., 2017 ).\nOur findings are supported by recent gene expression studies highlighting the importance of NF-\u03baB and NR4A receptors in the pathophysiology of arthritis. Integrative transcriptome analysis of a distinct hTNF-\u03b1 transgenic model with rapid onset of symptomatic arthropathy (Tg197,  Keffer et al., 1991 ) ranked NF-\u03baB as the most important transcription factor in this model ( Karagianni et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, the NR4A receptors exhibited disparate expression patterns in limbs from the Tg197 model; NR4A1 and 3 were downregulated and NR4A2 was not significantly altered. The hTNF-\u03b1 model used here expresses significantly lower levels of hTNF-\u03b1 and exhibits a gradual onset of symptoms that more closely models chronic RA ( Hayward et al., 2007 ). Another study of synovial gene expression profiles in OA identified NR4A2 as one of the top 10 transcription factors linked to differentially expressed genes from multiple microarray datasets ( Fei et al., 2016 ). However, NR4A2 was categorized as a downregulated gene in these OA synovial datasets, in contrast to its upregulation in OA cartilage ( Mix et al., 2007 ), RA synovium ( Murphy et al., 2001 ;  McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Ralph et al., 2010 ), and hTNF-\u03b1 joints in this study.\nNR4A expression and pharmacological targeting have been investigated in other mouse models of arthritis, providing broader insight into the therapeutic potential of these receptors .  In the K/BxN serum-induced model of RA ( Christianson et al., 2012 ), NR4A1-3 mRNA levels were elevated in inflamed ankles and NR4A2 expression was potently suppressed by dexamethasone and intra-articular injections of salmon calcitonin and hyaluronic acid ( Ryan et al., 2013 ). In CD4 +  T-cells isolated from DBA/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), NR4A1-3 mRNA levels were reduced relative to na\u00efve controls and the NR4A agonist cytosporone B improved clinical scores  in vivo  ( Saini et al., 2019 ). NR4A2 protein was detected in inflamed synovium and cartilage of ankle joints from the TNF -delta-ARE  model of chronic inflammation ( Kontonyiannis et al., 1999 ;  Smyth et al., 2019 ) and also in joints from the antigen-induced arthritis model in a pilot study ( Everett et al., 2015 ). Further investigation of the NR4A receptors in animal models of arthritis will provide greater insight into the mechanisms linking these transcription factors to inflammation and cartilage degradation  in vivo. \n\nRecent advances in synthetic NR4A ligands and endogenous receptor modulators have provided new strategies for targeting the NR4A receptors  in vitro  and  in vivo.  The ligand-binding domain of NR4A2 was once thought to be incompatible with the binding of endogenous ligands ( Wang et al., 2003 ), however structural studies have revealed that unsaturated fatty acids can bind to the canonical NR4A ligand-binding pocket and transactivate the NR4A2 receptor ( de Vera et al., 2016 ;  de Vera et al., 2019 ). Probing interactions between unsaturated fatty acids and NR4A receptors may lead to the development of new synthetic agents for selective receptor targeting. The purine anti-metabolite 6-mercaptopurine activates the NR4A receptors  in vitro,  suggesting some of the therapeutic actions of this widely used chemotherapeutic agent may also be mediated through the NR4A receptors ( Ordentlich et al., 2003 ;  Wansa et al., 2003 ;  Wansa and Muscat, 2005 ). Furthermore, multiple structurally-diverse agents have been identified that can regulate NR4A expression and transcriptional activity as selective agonists or antagonists ( Safe et al., 2016 ;  Munoz-Tello et al., 2020 ). Most relevant to the current study, the synthetic NR4A2 agonist 1,1-bis(3'-indolyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl) methane (C-DIM12) blocked TNF-\u03b1 induction of adhesion molecules and NF-\u03baB regulated genes in primary murine synovial fibroblasts ( Afzali et al., 2018 ), suggesting that this agent may be a candidate for  in vivo  testing in arthritis models.\nOur study has limitations but presents opportunities for in-depth studies of the impact of NR4A receptors on structural and symptomatic arthritis  in vivo.  This study was restricted to male hTNF-\u03b1 mice since they exhibit earlier symptoms and a higher degree of arthritis severity ( Hayward et al., 2007 ). Female mice should be included in future studies to address mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in the model. Microdissection of joint tissues would provide greater insight into the distribution of transcription factors and their potential target genes within hTNF-\u03b1 joints. Furthermore, determining the cell-type-specific expression patterns of the NR4A receptors within the hTNF-\u03b1 synovium would refine pharmacotherapeutic targeting strategies.\nIn conclusion our results provide the first spatiotemporal map of NR4A2 distribution in an animal model of arthritis and validate the hTNF-\u03b1 model for future testing of synthetic ligands and genetic strategies targeting this transcription factor  in vivo .\n"], "ner": [[[61, 65, "GENE"], [80, 85, "GENE"], [117, 119, "DISEASE"], [140, 145, "GENE"], [162, 167, "GENE"], [191, 196, "GENE"], [201, 205, "GENE"], [342, 349, "GENE"], [355, 360, "GENE"], [415, 420, "GENE"], [433, 438, "GENE"], [443, 448, "GENE"], [542, 547, "GENE"], [551, 556, "GENE"], [674, 681, "GENE"], [697, 702, "GENE"], [788, 792, "GENE"], [797, 802, "GENE"], [992, 997, "GENE"], [1110, 1115, "GENE"], [1227, 1232, "GENE"]], [[1390, 1395, "GENE"], [1457, 1461, "GENE"], [1514, 1519, "GENE"], [1584, 1588, "GENE"], [1590, 1596, "GENE"], [1598, 1607, "GENE"], [1609, 1612, "GENE"], [1790, 1795, "GENE"], [1808, 1813, "GENE"], [1921, 1926, "GENE"], [1997, 2002, "GENE"], [2208, 2213, "GENE"], [2237, 2242, "GENE"], [2244, 2248, "GENE"], [2326, 2331, "GENE"]], [[2426, 2428, "DISEASE"], [2668, 2673, "GENE"], [2694, 2696, "DISEASE"], [2721, 2729, "GENE"], [2734, 2738, "GENE"], [2858, 2863, "GENE"], [2933, 2938, "GENE"], [2940, 2947, "GENE"], [2954, 2958, "GENE"], [3028, 3033, "GENE"], [3094, 3096, "DISEASE"], [3220, 3225, "GENE"]], [[3313, 3318, "GENE"], [3323, 3327, "GENE"], [3358, 3363, "GENE"], [3399, 3406, "GENE"], [3635, 3640, "GENE"], [3642, 3646, "GENE"], [3878, 3882, "GENE"], [3924, 3929, "GENE"], [3931, 3935, "GENE"], [3937, 3944, "GENE"], [3946, 3952, "GENE"], [3958, 3963, "GENE"], [4216, 4221, "GENE"]], [[[4481, 4520], [4491, 4542], "RELATION"], [4495, 4500, "GENE"], [4546, 4555, "DISEASE"], [4607, 4612, "GENE"], [4712, 4717, "GENE"], [4909, 4914, "GENE"], [4944, 4949, "GENE"], [4986, 4991, "GENE"], [5049, 5054, "GENE"], [5129, 5131, "DISEASE"], [5212, 5214, "DISEASE"], [5226, 5231, "GENE"], [5381, 5386, "GENE"], [5408, 5421, "RELATION"], [5436, 5438, "DISEASE"], [5477, 5489, "RELATION"], [5493, 5495, "DISEASE"], [5660, 5665, "GENE"]], [[5688, 5692, "GENE"], [5782, 5791, "DISEASE"], [5908, 5910, "DISEASE"], [5942, 5947, "GENE"], [5999, 6004, "GENE"], [6155, 6158, "GENE"], [6217, 6226, "DISEASE"], [6234, 6239, "GENE"], [6302, 6306, "GENE"], [6388, 6393, "GENE"], [6706, 6710, "GENE"], [6741, 6750, "DISEASE"]], [[7084, 7089, "GENE"], [7333, 7338, "GENE"], [8124, 8129, "GENE"], [8203, 8208, "GENE"], [8245, 8250, "GENE"]], [[8511, 8515, "GENE"], [8556, 8565, "DISEASE"], [8612, 8617, "GENE"], [8682, 8691, "DISEASE"], [8984, 8989, "GENE"], [9073, 9077, "GENE"], [9100, 9105, "GENE"]], [[9236, 9241, "GENE"], [9277, 9286, "DISEASE"], [9305, 9310, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [[4495, 4500, 4546, 4555, "pathological role"], [5381, 5386, 5436, 5438, "decreased expression"], [5381, 5386, 5493, 5495, "increased expression"]], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [[4495, 4500, 4546, 4555, [4481, 4520], [4491, 4542]], [5381, 5386, 5436, 5438, 5408, 5421], [5381, 5386, 5493, 5495, 5477, 5489]], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [["NF - \u03baB", "arthritis", "importance in the pathophysiology"], ["NR4A2", "OA", "downregulated"], ["NR4A2", "OA", "upregulation"]], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], "sentences": ["\nThis study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the NR4A receptors and NF-\u03baB in a transgenic mouse model of RA driven by the human TNF-\u03b1 cytokine. Since TNF-\u03b1 is a potent inducer of NF-\u03baB and NR4A receptors in human joint cells, we hypothesized that these transcription factors would also be expressed in arthritic joints  in vivo . NF-\u03baB 1  and NR4A2 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in whole paws from hTNF-\u03b1 mice, while NR4A1 and NR4A3 were not differentially expressed ( Figure 2 ). Consistent with transcriptional induction of NR4A2 by NF-\u03baB in human joint cells ( McEvoy et al., 2002 ;  Ralph et al., 2005 ;  Mix et al., 2007 ), we documented an increase in NF-\u03baB 1  mRNA prior to NR4A2 upregulation at the late disease stage. Furthermore, we detected potent increases in RelA and NR4A2 proteins in inflamed synovium by immunohistochemistry ( Figures 3 ,  4 ), suggesting that gene expression patterns in whole paws are largely driven by changes in the synovium. In contrast, NR4A2 was constitutively expressed in the resting zone of cartilage but decreased at the late stage of disease. Since NR4A2 is a constitutively active transcription factor tightly regulated at the level of expression, the detection of NR4A2 protein in articular surfaces and synovium suggests this receptor is transcriptionally active in resident chondrocytes and synoviocytes.\n", "Our results in the hTNF-\u03b1 model are consistent with tissue-specific activities for the NR4A receptors in joints. In human synovial fibroblasts, NR4A2 exacerbates inflammation and tissue degradation by upregulating IL-8, MMP-13, prolactin, CRH, and CRH-receptor1 ( Murphy et al., 2001 ;  Davies et al., 2005 ;  Ralph et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Mix et al., 2012 ;  McCoy et al., 2015 ). In human chondrocytes, NR4A2 antagonizes MMP-1, 3, and 9 gene expression and contributes to chondroprotection ( Mix et al., 2007 ). However, depletion of NR4A1-3 in human chondrocytes antagonizes histamine-dependent regulation of RANKL expression, providing evidence for differential modulation of genes involved in cartilage degradation ( Marzaioli et al., 2012 ). In addition, studies in rat chondrocytes support a protective function for NR4A1 through suppression of COX-2, iNOS, and MMP expression ( Xiong et al., 2020 ), while other studies suggest that NR4A3 has opposing effects ( Ma et al., 2020 ).\n", "By screening a broader panel of genes implicated in RA, we generated evidence of increased expression of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, matrix degrading enzymes and inhibitors, cell surface receptors, intracellular signaling proteins and transcription factors that support the hTNF-\u03b1 mouse as a model of RA ( Figure 5 ). Of these, IL-1beta and CCL5 were the most potently induced genes, consistent with the known activation of these promoters in response to increased TNF-\u03b1 signaling ( Turner et al., 1989 ;  Lee et al., 2000 ). Additionally, NR4A2, NF-\u03baB 1 , and RelA were also upregulated concurrent with increases in endogenous murine TNF-\u03b1. This screen focused on a select group of genes involved in RA and as such our results do not reflect the full spectrum of aberrant gene expression changes that may be occurring within hTNF-\u03b1 joints.\n", "Promoter analysis of differentially expressed genes supports central roles for NF-\u03baB and NR4A transcription factors in the hTNF-\u03b1 model. Consensus binding sites for NF-\u03baB 1  were predicted in the promoters of 58% of the induced genes in contrast to only 36% of the stable genes ( Table 1 ). Several of these differentially expressed genes have been previously recognized as transcriptional targets of NF-\u03baB. NR4A monomeric binding sites known as Nurr binding response elements (NBRE: AAACCGTA) were also enriched in the promoters of differentially expressed genes. Among the genes containing these promoter elements ( Supplementary Table S2 ), NR4A receptors have been reported to regulate BCL-2, IL-6, CXCL-12, CXCR-4, and MMP-9 in various cellular contexts ( Johnson et al., 2011 ,  Bonta et al., 2006 ,  Mix et al., 2007 ,  Duren et al., 2016 ). NR4A receptors can also modulate gene expression through heterodimeric binding with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and interactions with NF-\u03baB and erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) transcription factors ( Mix et al., 2007 ;  Aherne et al., 2009 ;  Saijo et al., 2009 ;  Duren et al., 2016 ;  McEvoy et al., 2017 ).\n", "Our findings are supported by recent gene expression studies highlighting the importance of NF-\u03baB and NR4A receptors in the pathophysiology of arthritis.

{"doc_key": "8123883_4. Materials and Methods", "text": ["\n4.1. Cell Culture\nWe obtained human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Catholic MASTER Cells from the Catholic Institute of Cell Therapy (CIC, Seoul, Korea). We purchased human outer root sheath cells (hORSCs) from ScienCell (San Diego, CA, USA) and cultured them, as previously described [ 49 ]. hORSCs (1 \u00d7 10 5  cells per well) were seeded into six-well culture plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose, Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, BRL) for 24 h. hORSCs at passage three to five were used for the experiments. Then, hORSCs were seeded on culture dish plates with serum-free DMEM, and the plates were co-cultured with upper chamber containing hHMSCs.\n4.2. Co-Culture\nThe co-culture of hORSCs and hHMSCs was performed as previously described [ 50 ]. hORSCs were seeded in the lower chambers of Transwell culture plates (Cell Culture Insert Companion Plate; Corning, Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 5  cells per well. hHMSCs were added to the upper chamber of the Transwell in separate plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 4  cells per well. The upper chambers were coated with polyethylene terephthalate (pore size: 0.8 mm, six-well format, Cell Culture Inserts; Corning, Falcon). After 24 h, the media was changed to serum-free DMEM and the upper chamber containing hHMSCs was transferred to the wells where the hORSCs were cultured to produce the co-culture. The IFN-gamma group was treated with recombinant human IFN-gamma at 100 ng/mL, obtained from Peprotech (315-05, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). After different times (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h), the upper chamber was removed and washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, T&I, Bioprince, Chuncheon, Korea). Next, the hORSCs were harvested and used for analysis. The experiment was repeated three times.\n4.3. Cell Viability Assay (MTT Assay)\nCell viability was measured via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. After co-culturing for different times, the MTT reagent was added and reacted for 2 h. The reagent was removed, and the resulting formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) [ 51 ]. Then, the samples were assessed by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plate reader.\n4.4. Real-Time PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from the hORSCs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and cDNA was synthesized with the MG cDNA Synthesis Kit (CancerROP, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed with primers and Moloney-murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (RTase) (CancerROP, Seoul, Korea). Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Master mix (CancerROP, Seoul, Korea). The gene expression levels were quantified using analysis software (Quantity One 1-D analysis, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The primer sequences are listed in  Supplementary Table S1 . The primers were designed and obtained from Bioneer (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea).\n4.5. Western Blot Analysis\nhORSCs were harvested with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA). The amount of protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA) and compared to bovine serum albumin (ThermoFisher) standards. Cell lysates containing the same quantity of total protein were separated by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST for an hour at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Primary antibodies against phospho-JAK1-3, total-JAK1-3, phospho-STAT1-3 total-STAT1-3, DKK1, IL-15, phospho-GSK-3beta, GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, SOX9, CD34, CD200, and GAPDH were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Cell Signal, Beverly, MA, USA). On the following day, the membranes were washed with TBST several times and incubated in peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) for 2 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (ThermoFisher) and were obtained using a chemiluminescence imaging system (ChemiDoc Imaging System; Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase.\n4.6. Transwell Migration Assay\nThe migration of hORSCs was measured using Transwell plates that were 6.5 mm in diameter with 8 \u03bcm pore filters. The Transwell system was separated from the lower segment by a permeable membrane coated with polyethylene terephthalate. The upper chambers were loaded with 1 \u00d7 10 5  hORSCs that were already treated with IFN-gamma or hHMSCs. The number of hHMSCs and density of IFN-gamma were the same as those used in the co-culture procedure. DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chambers. After incubation for 15 h at room temperature, the cells in the upper chamber were carefully removed using a cotton swab and the membranes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cells that had migrated under the filter were stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min and then observed under a light microscope [ 52 ]. The cells in five randomly selected visual fields under each membrane were counted.\n4.7. Hair Follicle Organ Culture Assay\nSix-week-old female C57BL/6 mouse vibrissae follicles were micro-dissected under sterile conditions, as previously described [ 9 ]. Individual follicles were placed in a 24-well tissue culture plate in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose, Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany), which was supplemented with hydrocortisone, insulin, and glutamine in the presence of IFN-gamma (100 ng/mL) or hHMSCs. hHMSCs were added to the Transwell upper chamber in separate plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 4  cells per well as described in the co-culture method. At least 20 HFs were cultured individually with control, IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma plus MSCT, or MSCT. The culture medium was changed every three days, and images of individual follicles were filmed before and after hHMSCs treatment. All procedures were carried out under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols (CUMC-2019-0061-02, date of approval: 24 July 2019).\nThe length of vibrissae HFs from the top of hair to the bottom of the hair bulb in organ culture was measured with a microscope every third day for 10 days.

We purchased human outer root sheath cells (hORSCs) from ScienCell (San Diego, CA, USA) and cultured them, as previously described [ 49 ]. hORSCs (1 \u00d7 10 5  cells per well) were seeded into six-well culture plates in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose, Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Life Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, BRL) for 24 h. hORSCs at passage three to five were used for the experiments. Then, hORSCs were seeded on culture dish plates with serum-free DMEM, and the plates were co-cultured with upper chamber containing hHMSCs.\n", "4.2. Co-Culture\nThe co-culture of hORSCs and hHMSCs was performed as previously described [ 50 ]. hORSCs were seeded in the lower chambers of Transwell culture plates (Cell Culture Insert Companion Plate; Corning, Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 5  cells per well. hHMSCs were added to the upper chamber of the Transwell in separate plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 10 4  cells per well. The upper chambers were coated with polyethylene terephthalate (pore size: 0.8 mm, six-well format, Cell Culture Inserts; Corning, Falcon). After 24 h, the media was changed to serum-free DMEM and the upper chamber containing hHMSCs was transferred to the wells where the hORSCs were cultured to produce the co-culture. The IFN-gamma group was treated with recombinant human IFN-gamma at 100 ng/mL, obtained from Peprotech (315-05, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). After different times (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h), the upper chamber was removed and washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, T&I, Bioprince, Chuncheon, Korea).

{"doc_key": "8123883_3. Discussion", "text": ["\nhHMSCs have received attention as a promising therapeutic strategy because of their immunomodulatory effects on various types of cells [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. We wanted to investigate how MSCT could affect anagen re-entry signaling and hair growth-promotion in IFN-gamma-treated hORSCs, which is similar to the AA microenvironment. The results showed that MSCT upregulated hORSC viability, migration, and the expression of anagen-re-entry-related genes, unlike IFN-gamma treatment ( Figure 1 ,  Figure 3  and  Figure 8 ). We found that the NLRP3 inflammasome components highly expressed after IFN-gamma treatment were efficiently suppressed by MSCT ( Figure 2 ). IFN-gamma signature genes and JAK/STAT-related pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by IFN-gamma were decreased by MSCT. The anti-inflammatory cytokine  IL-10 , which contributes to the immunomodulatory effects of MSCT, was increased by MSCT. Hair growth factors were upregulated by MSCT ( Figure 6 ). The immunomodulatory effects of MSCT on hORSCs appeared to be associated with Wnt/beta-catenin stimulation and inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway ( Figure 4 ,  Figure 5  and  Figure 7 ).\nInflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, are known to lead to the collapse of HF-IP by upregulation of expression of MHC class I a and MICA inside the HF.\nMICA is a polymorphic protein that is induced upon stress, damage or transformation of cells. In AA, NKG2D+ Natural killer cells (NK cells) attack MICA positive HFs, which results in apoptosis and hair loss [ 25 ]. According to studies, upregulation of MICA in lesional AA enhances the susceptibility of attack by NK cells on the HFs, which may then promote anagen termination and AA progression. MSCs have a suppressive effect on the proliferation of activated helper T cells, caused by cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase [ 26 ]. The inhibition of T cell proliferation reduces IFN-gamma secretion by Th1 cells and IL-17 secretion from Th17 cells and increases IL-4, IL-10 secretion by Th2 cells. In this study, MICA was significantly induced by IFN-gamma in hORSCs but downregulated by MSCT ( Figure 3 ). This may suggest that MSCT inhibits the expression of IFN-gamma induced MICA in hORSCs.\nThe Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is important for hair morphogenesis and anagen re-entry [ 27 ]. beta-catenin is required to increase the proliferation of bulge stem cells [ 28 ]. Cyclin D1 is a member of the cyclin protein family that is involved in regulating cell cycle progression. It is known to increase during the G0/G1 phase and to initiate DNA synthesis. Cyclin D1 and Axin2 are one of the target genes of the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway. They are direct downstream molecules activated by beta-catenin. LEF1 is a transcription factor that is primarily involved in the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway [ 29 ]. They are also important for anagen re-entry and cell proliferation.\nIn this study, MSCT significantly induced Wnt family proteins, beta-catenin, GSK-3beta and cyclin D1 expression. Among the Wnt family proteins, Wnt3a and 10b are related to the hair cycle and regeneration, and increase anagen gene expression. Kishimoto et al. generated Wnt3a-overexpressing keratinocyte feeder cells and co-cultured the cells with freshly isolated murine DPCs. In this experiment, Wnt3a was found to increase beta-catenin expression and increase hair growth in nude mice that underwent skin remodeling composed of DPCs and keratinocytes [ 30 ]. Wnt5a is known as a downstream molecule of the sonic hedgehog signaling cascade and is upregulated during the early morphogenetic stages [ 31 , 32 ]. We also demonstrated that MSCT suppressed the expression of DKK1 in IFN-gamma-induced hORSCs. However, this did not seem to be caused by TGF-beta2. The reason for this is that  TGF-beta2  mRNA was only increased by IFN-gamma treatment and not by MSCT in this study. Most of the Wnt/beta-catenin-related molecules were increased by MSCT conditions in vitro. This suggests that MSCT could help induce anagen re-entry by stimulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway.\nSOX9 is characteristically expressed in CD34-positive hORSCs in the bulge area and is involved in the regulation of bulge formation and stem cell transcription [ 33 , 34 , 35 ]. CD34 and CD200 are known as human follicular stem cell markers. Keratin15 is one of the most widely used markers of bulge stem cells [ 36 ]. Since SOX9 is known as a beta-catenin-regulated gene, the MSCT-induced enhanced expression of SOX9 may result from the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by MSCT. CD200 suppresses the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and improves the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The expression of SOX9, CD34, CD200, and Keratin15 protein was increased after hHMSC co-culture ( Figure 5 ). This supports that MSCT could strengthen the stemness of HF stem cells in the bulge area of hORSCs [ 30 ].\nIn AA, dystrophic HFs are often observed instead of normal HFs because hORSCs are attacked by inflammatory cells around the HFs and the immune privilege of the HFs is disrupted. The main role of hORSCs is to secrete and react to inflammatory substances. hORSCs are important immunocompetent cells that express NLRP3 inflammasomes constitutively in the HFs [ 19 ]. Therefore, we investigated the MSCT response with inflammasome markers, which are closely related to hORSCs. In our study, the inflammasome components were upregulated by IFN-gamma treatment and downregulated by MSCT ( Figure 2 ). This finding may suggest new ways for regulating the inflammasome activation pathway and represent a way to prevent or treat AA.\nWe also found that the IFN-gamma-induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines of AA ( Figure 3 ) were suppressed by MSCT in hORSCs [ 37 , 38 ]. Due to the inflammatory response, these molecules disrupt the immune privilege of HFs, induce dystrophic change and catagen, and prevent anagen re-entry. In contrast,  IL-10  is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that has the opposite effect. These results can be the outcome of JAK/STAT pathway activation. Recent studies have shown that increased JAK-STAT signaling suppressed HF stem cell function in vitro and that STAT5 signaling regulated HF stem cell quiescence [ 39 , 40 ]. Even if the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is important in skin inflammation, the role of JAK/STAT signaling in hORSCs has not yet been studied.\nIn this study, the phosphorylation of JAK1-3 and STAT1 was significantly decreased in hORSCs by MSCT, which reverted the IFN-gamma-induced proinflammatory changes. Although the downregulation of STAT3 in the IFN-gamma-hHMSCs treated group was not significant compared to the IFN-gamma-treated groups, the changes were significant compared to the controls in Western blotting analysis. We suggest that MSCT suppress IFN-gamma signaling through downregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. This result suggests that the MSCT-suppressed activation of JAK1/2 reversed catagen induction and induced a potential mechanism involved in the new hair cycle. TGF-beta is well known as an inducer of regression [ 41 ]. In accordance with that, the TGF-beta2 mRNA in hORSCs was significantly upregulated in response to IFN-gamma treatment and was reduced by MSCT in this study.\nWe also found a significant increase in the mRNA expression of hair growth factors in hORSCs by MSCT. IGF-1 is a well-known anagen-prolonging factor and restored the immune activity of hair follicles [ 42 ]. PDGF is related to the induction and maintenance of the anagen phase, and FGF and is known as a hORSC growth factor. VEGF is involved in accelerating hair growth, increasing follicle size through follicular angiogenesis and stimulating ORSCs migration [ 43 , 44 ]. SHH has been found to regulate the angiogenic growth factor such as VEGF. BMP2, BMP4 activation is known to elaborately regulate the development of HF bulge stem cell activation and growth during the hair cycle [ 45 ]. hHMSCs secrete several growth factors such as VEGF, and FGF, which lead to escalated cell proliferation, regeneration and promote the migration of cells. As shown in  Figure 6 ,  IGF1, FGF2, FGF7, PDGF ,  VEGF, SHH, BMP2  and  BMP4  mRNA expression was suppressed by IFN-gamma, and MSCT had a stimulatory effect on the transcription of growth factors. Our results indicate that MSCT increased hair growth factors to facilitate the viability and migration of hORSCs ( Figure 1  and  Figure 8 ).\nWe previously studied the efficacy of MSCT in hDPCs, one of the key cells that make up the hair bulge [ 37 ]. There are similarities and differences between the results of that study and the results of the current research. As for the similarities, in hDPCs, MSCT also reduced the inflammatory markers  caspases-1  and  IFN-gammaR . In addition, the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway markers Wnt10, beta-catenin, and pGSK-3beta increased, and DKK1 decreased in both cells. The growth factor  FGF2  increased and the catagen inducer  TGF-beta2  decreased, suggesting that in hDPCs and hORSCs, hHMSCs treat inflammation-related substances and are involved in the regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and promote the secretion of growth factors. As for the differences, the inflammatory substances  IL-15, TNF-\u03b1,  and  IL-1beta  were increased in hDPCs after hHMSCs treatment, whereas there was a clear decrease in cytokines in the hORSCs. Since cells secreting inflammatory substances such as IL-15 and TNF-\u03b1 are mainly hORSCs, it can be inferred that MSCT could be relatively safe to use for HFs in vivo based on this result. Additionally, there was a clear difference in the JAK/STAT pathway-related results. In hDPCs, MSCT increased the expression levels of STAT1 and STAT3 compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group. Thus, the JAK/STAT pathway acted as an anagen re-entry signal here. In contrast, in this study, MSCT in hORSCs reduced the expression levels of STAT1 and STAT3, which subsequently offset the proinflammatory effect of IFN-gamma. This result may be because MSCT in hORSCs acted as a pro-inflammatory effect on the JAK/STAT pathway. The different interactions seemed to result from the different properties of each cell type.\nIn our study, the migration ability of hORSCs was increased by MSCT, which was decreased by IFN-gamma treatment ( Figure 8 ). The migration ability of hORSCs is one of the important factors in HFs growth. hORSCs migration is necessary and sufficient to proceed with the hair cycle. hORSCs represent a very proliferative compartment in the HFs during the anagen phase [ 38 ]. This is an important part of hair growth in the hair cycle.\nAs shown in  Figure 6 , MSCT increases the expression level of hair growth factors related with cell migration in hORSCs. In addition, hHMSCs secretes multiple growth factors, which help cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, this result means that MSCT can play an active role in HFs growth by enhancing cell viability and migration under the microenvironment with HF-IP collapse.\nIn this study, we demonstrated that MSCT increase hair shaft growth in mouse vibrissae organ culture ( Figure 9 ). As shown in  Figure 9 , hair bulbs were preserved in the MSCT treated group contrary to the IFN-gamma group, in which the hair bulb was curved. This is one of the catagen-like regressive changes in hair bulb. Our results suggest that MSCT increases hair growth factors ( Figure 6 ) and stimulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to stimulate cyclin D1 ( Figure 4 ) and suppress the catagen inducer TGF-beta2. MSCT also blocks the proinflammation effects of IFN-gamma through inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway. Through these pathways, anagen re-entry and anagen prolongation would be improved in HF.\nRecent studies have shown that induced pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into MSCs to have DPC characteristics when exposed to a certain environment [ 46 ]. These MSCs were able to partially reproduce the characteristics of DPC, such as showing a DPC-related marker and raising HF-related genes. In addition, amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium promoted telogen-anagen conversion in HFs and increased HF density, mimicking the role of DPC [ 47 ]. Originally, MSCs and DPCs are from the mesoderm, which are different from hair keratinocytes which are ectodermal in origin [ 48 ]. Based on these studies, we predict that MSCs could change to have the ability to activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and to induce anagen-reentry by modifying self-characteristics, similarly to DPCs in certain aspects, when co-cultured with hair keratinocytes.\nIn association with AA, the effect of MSCT on hORSCs was first investigated in this study. Our results show that MSCT could induce anagen re-entry-related molecules in hORSCs. MSCT may induce anagen re-entry through activation of Wnt/beta-catenin, inhibition of the JAK/ STAT pathway, HF-IP collapse-related genes, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Various growth factors related to AA were enhanced in response to MSCT. MSCT could increase hORSC viability and migration which results in hair shaft growth. MSCT can be an attractive treatment for refractory AA patients at various stages. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal clinical setting for MSCT.\n"], "ner": [[[266, 275, "GENE"], [316, 318, "DISEASE"], [466, 475, "GENE"], [545, 550, "GENE"], [598, 607, "GENE"], [668, 677, "GENE"], [753, 762, "GENE"], [819, 824, "GENE"]], [[1197, 1206, "GENE"]], [[1322, 1326, "GENE"], [1419, 1421, "DISEASE"], [1423, 1428, "GENE"], [1469, 1473, "GENE"], [1559, 1571, "RELATION"], [1575, 1579, "GENE"], [1592, 1594, "DISEASE"], [1902, 1911, "GENE"], [1939, 1944, "GENE"], [2036, 2040, "GENE"], [2184, 2193, "GENE"], [2202, 2206, "GENE"]], [[2321, 2333, "GENE"], [2404, 2413, "GENE"], [2588, 2597, "GENE"], [2602, 2607, "GENE"], [2726, 2738, "GENE"], [2740, 2744, "GENE"]], [[2989, 3001, "GENE"], [3003, 3012, "GENE"], [3017, 3026, "GENE"], [3070, 3075, "GENE"], [3196, 3201, "GENE"], [3324, 3329, "GENE"], [3352, 3364, "GENE"], [3488, 3493, "GENE"], [3698, 3702, "GENE"], [3706, 3715, "GENE"], [3775, 3784, "GENE"], [3815, 3824, "GENE"], [3854, 3862, "GENE"]], [[4105, 4109, "GENE"], [4145, 4149, "GENE"], [4283, 4287, "GENE"], [4292, 4297, "GENE"], [4347, 4356, "GENE"], [4430, 4434, "GENE"], [4449, 4461, "GENE"], [4518, 4522, "GENE"], [4593, 4598, "GENE"], [4657, 4662, "GENE"], [4724, 4729, "GENE"], [4749, 4753, "GENE"], [4755, 4759, "GENE"], [4761, 4766, "GENE"], [4772, 4781, "GENE"]], [[4951, 4953, "DISEASE"], [5258, 5263, "GENE"], [5483, 5492, "GENE"], [5668, 5670, "DISEASE"]], [[5695, 5704, "GENE"], [5757, 5759, "DISEASE"], [5988, 5993, "GENE"], [6234, 6239, "GENE"]], [[6476, 6480, "GENE"], [6487, 6492, "GENE"], [6559, 6568, "GENE"], [6633, 6638, "GENE"], [6646, 6655, "GENE"], [6713, 6722, "GENE"], [6853, 6862, "GENE"], [6981, 6985, "GENE"], [7081, 7089, "GENE"], [7169, 7178, "GENE"], [7239, 7248, "GENE"]], [[7400, 7405, "GENE"], [7771, 7774, "GENE"], [7845, 7849, "GENE"], [7851, 7855, "GENE"], [8169, 8173, "GENE"], [8175, 8179, "GENE"], [8181, 8185, "GENE"], [8201, 8204, "GENE"], [8206, 8210, "GENE"], [8217, 8221, "GENE"], [8257, 8266, "GENE"]], [[8804, 8814, "GENE"], [8877, 8882, "GENE"], [8884, 8896, "GENE"], [8903, 8912, "GENE"], [8928, 8932, "GENE"], [8977, 8981, "GENE"], [9018, 9027, "GENE"], [9285, 9290, "GENE"], [9292, 9297, "GENE"], [9305, 9313, "GENE"], [9480, 9485, "GENE"], [9490, 9495, "GENE"], [9748, 9753, "GENE"], [9758, 9763, "GENE"], [9780, 9789, "GENE"], [9949, 9954, "GENE"], [9959, 9964, "GENE"], [10022, 10031, "GENE"]], [[10320, 10329, "GENE"]], [], [[11258, 11267, "GENE"], [11503, 11512, "GENE"], [11559, 11568, "GENE"], [11618, 11627, "GENE"]], [], [[12668, 12670, "DISEASE"], [12967, 12972, "GENE"], [13032, 13034, "DISEASE"], [13207, 13209, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [[1575, 1579, 1592, 1594, "increased expression"]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [[1575, 1579, 1592, 1594, 1559, 1571]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [["MICA", "AA", "upregulation"]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], "sentences": ["\nhHMSCs have received attention as a promising therapeutic strategy because of their immunomodulatory effects on various types of cells [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ].

In this study, MICA was significantly induced by IFN-gamma in hORSCs but downregulated by MSCT ( Figure 3 ). This may suggest that MSCT inhibits the expression of IFN-gamma induced MICA in hORSCs.\n", "The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is important for hair morphogenesis and anagen re-entry [ 27 ]. beta-catenin is required to increase the proliferation of bulge stem cells [ 28 ]. Cyclin D1 is a member of the cyclin protein family that is involved in regulating cell cycle progression. It is known to increase during the G0/G1 phase and to initiate DNA synthesis. Cyclin D1 and Axin2 are one of the target genes of the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway. They are direct downstream molecules activated by beta-catenin. LEF1 is a transcription factor that is primarily involved in the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway [ 29 ]. They are also important for anagen re-entry and cell proliferation.\n", "In this study, MSCT significantly induced Wnt family proteins, beta-catenin, GSK-3beta and cyclin D1 expression. Among the Wnt family proteins, Wnt3a and 10b are related to the hair cycle and regeneration, and increase anagen gene expression. Kishimoto et al. generated Wnt3a-overexpressing keratinocyte feeder cells and co-cultured the cells with freshly isolated murine DPCs. In this experiment, Wnt3a was found to increase beta-catenin expression and increase hair growth in nude mice that underwent skin remodeling composed of DPCs and keratinocytes [ 30 ]. Wnt5a is known as a downstream molecule of the sonic hedgehog signaling cascade and is upregulated during the early morphogenetic stages [ 31 , 32 ]. We also demonstrated that MSCT suppressed the expression of DKK1 in IFN-gamma-induced hORSCs. However, this did not seem to be caused by TGF-beta2. The reason for this is that  TGF-beta2  mRNA was only increased by IFN-gamma treatment and not by MSCT in this study. Most of the Wnt/beta-catenin-related molecules were increased by MSCT conditions in vitro. This suggests that MSCT could help induce anagen re-entry by stimulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway.\n", "SOX9 is characteristically expressed in CD34-positive hORSCs in the bulge area and is involved in the regulation of bulge formation and stem cell transcription [ 33 , 34 , 35 ]. CD34 and CD200 are known as human follicular stem cell markers. Keratin15 is one of the most widely used markers of bulge stem cells [ 36 ]. Since SOX9 is known as a beta-catenin-regulated gene, the MSCT-induced enhanced expression of SOX9 may result from the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by MSCT. CD200 suppresses the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and improves the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The expression of SOX9, CD34, CD200, and Keratin15 protein was increased after hHMSC co-culture ( Figure 5 ). This supports that MSCT could strengthen the stemness of HF stem cells in the bulge area of hORSCs [ 30 ].\n", "In AA, dystrophic HFs are often observed instead of normal HFs because hORSCs are attacked by inflammatory cells around the HFs and the immune privilege of the HFs is disrupted. The main role of hORSCs is to secrete and react to inflammatory substances. hORSCs are important immunocompetent cells that express NLRP3 inflammasomes constitutively in the HFs [ 19 ]. Therefore, we investigated the MSCT response with inflammasome markers, which are closely related to hORSCs. In our study, the inflammasome components were upregulated by IFN-gamma treatment and downregulated by MSCT ( Figure 2 ). This finding may suggest new ways for regulating the inflammasome activation pathway and represent a way to prevent or treat AA.\n", "We also found that the IFN-gamma-induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines of AA ( Figure 3 ) were suppressed by MSCT in hORSCs [ 37 , 38 ]. Due to the inflammatory response, these molecules disrupt the immune privilege of HFs, induce dystrophic change and catagen, and prevent anagen re-entry. In contrast,  IL-10  is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that has the opposite effect. These results can be the outcome of JAK/STAT pathway activation. Recent studies have shown that increased JAK-STAT signaling suppressed HF stem cell function in vitro and that STAT5 signaling regulated HF stem cell quiescence [ 39 , 40 ]. Even if the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is important in skin inflammation, the role of JAK/STAT signaling in hORSCs has not yet been studied.\n", "In this study, the phosphorylation of JAK1-3 and STAT1 was significantly decreased in hORSCs by MSCT, which reverted the IFN-gamma-induced proinflammatory changes. Although the downregulation of STAT3 in the IFN-gamma-hHMSCs treated group was not significant compared to the IFN-gamma-treated groups, the changes were significant compared to the controls in Western blotting analysis. We suggest that MSCT suppress IFN-gamma signaling through downregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. This result suggests that the MSCT-suppressed activation of JAK1/2 reversed catagen induction and induced a potential mechanism involved in the new hair cycle. TGF-beta is well known as an inducer of regression [ 41 ]. In accordance with that, the TGF-beta2 mRNA in hORSCs was significantly upregulated in response to IFN-gamma treatment and was reduced by MSCT in this study.\n", "We also found a significant increase in the mRNA expression of hair growth factors in hORSCs by MSCT. IGF-1 is a well-known anagen-prolonging factor and restored the immune activity of hair follicles [ 42 ]. PDGF is related to the induction and maintenance of the anagen phase, and FGF and is known as a hORSC growth factor. VEGF is involved in accelerating hair growth, increasing follicle size through follicular angiogenesis and stimulating ORSCs migration [ 43 , 44 ]. SHH has been found to regulate the angiogenic growth factor such as VEGF. BMP2, BMP4 activation is known to elaborately regulate the development of HF bulge stem cell activation and growth during the hair cycle [ 45 ]. hHMSCs secrete several growth factors such as VEGF, and FGF, which lead to escalated cell proliferation, regeneration and promote the migration of cells. As shown in  Figure 6 ,  IGF1, FGF2, FGF7, PDGF ,  VEGF, SHH, BMP2  and  BMP4  mRNA expression was suppressed by IFN-gamma, and MSCT had a stimulatory effect on the transcription of growth factors. Our results indicate that MSCT increased hair growth factors to facilitate the viability and migration of hORSCs ( Figure 1  and  Figure 8 ).\n", "We previously studied the efficacy of MSCT in hDPCs, one of the key cells that make up the hair bulge [ 37 ]. There are similarities and differences between the results of that study and the results of the current research. As for the similarities, in hDPCs, MSCT also reduced the inflammatory markers  caspases-1  and  IFN-gammaR . In addition, the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway markers Wnt10, beta-catenin, and pGSK-3beta increased, and DKK1 decreased in both cells. The growth factor  FGF2  increased and the catagen inducer  TGF-beta2  decreased, suggesting that in hDPCs and hORSCs, hHMSCs treat inflammation-related substances and are involved in the regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and promote the secretion of growth factors. As for the differences, the inflammatory substances  IL-15, TNF-\u03b1,  and  IL-1beta  were increased in hDPCs after hHMSCs treatment, whereas there was a clear decrease in cytokines in the hORSCs. Since cells secreting inflammatory substances such as IL-15 and TNF-\u03b1 are mainly hORSCs, it can be inferred that MSCT could be relatively safe to use for HFs in vivo based on this result. Additionally, there was a clear difference in the JAK/STAT pathway-related results. In hDPCs, MSCT increased the expression levels of STAT1 and STAT3 compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group. Thus, the JAK/STAT pathway acted as an anagen re-entry signal here. In contrast, in this study, MSCT in hORSCs reduced the expression levels of STAT1 and STAT3, which subsequently offset the proinflammatory effect of IFN-gamma. This result may be because MSCT in hORSCs acted as a pro-inflammatory effect on the JAK/STAT pathway. The different interactions seemed to result from the different properties of each cell type.\n", "In our study, the migration ability of hORSCs was increased by MSCT, which was decreased by IFN-gamma treatment ( Figure 8 ). The migration ability of hORSCs is one of the important factors in HFs growth. hORSCs migration is necessary and sufficient to proceed with the hair cycle. hORSCs represent a very proliferative compartment in the HFs during the anagen phase [ 38 ]. This is an important part of hair growth in the hair cycle.\n", "As shown in  Figure 6 , MSCT increases the expression level of hair growth factors related with cell migration in hORSCs. In addition, hHMSCs secretes multiple growth factors, which help cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, this result means that MSCT can play an active role in HFs growth by enhancing cell viability and migration under the microenvironment with HF-IP collapse.\n", "In this study, we demonstrated that MSCT increase hair shaft growth in mouse vibrissae organ culture ( Figure 9 ). As shown in  Figure 9 , hair bulbs were preserved in the MSCT treated group contrary to the IFN-gamma group, in which the hair bulb was curved. This is one of the catagen-like regressive changes in hair bulb. Our results suggest that MSCT increases hair growth factors ( Figure 6 ) and stimulates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling to stimulate cyclin D1 ( Figure 4 ) and suppress the catagen inducer TGF-beta2. MSCT also blocks the proinflammation effects of IFN-gamma through inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway. Through these pathways, anagen re-entry and anagen prolongation would be improved in HF.\n", "Recent studies have shown that induced pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into MSCs to have DPC characteristics when exposed to a certain environment [ 46 ]. These MSCs were able to partially reproduce the characteristics of DPC, such as showing a DPC-related marker and raising HF-related genes. In addition, amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium promoted telogen-anagen conversion in HFs and increased HF density, mimicking the role of DPC [ 47 ]. Originally, MSCs and DPCs are from the mesoderm, which are different from hair keratinocytes which are ectodermal in origin [ 48 ]. Based on these studies, we predict that MSCs could change to have the ability to activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and to induce anagen-reentry by modifying self-characteristics, similarly to DPCs in certain aspects, when co-cultured with hair keratinocytes.\n", "In association with AA, the effect of MSCT on hORSCs was first investigated in this study. Our results show that MSCT could induce anagen re-entry-related molecules in hORSCs. MSCT may induce anagen re-entry through activation of Wnt/beta-catenin, inhibition of the JAK/ STAT pathway, HF-IP collapse-related genes, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Various growth factors related to AA were enhanced in response to MSCT. MSCT could increase hORSC viability and migration which results in hair shaft growth. MSCT can be an attractive treatment for refractory AA patients at various stages. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal clinical setting for MSCT.\n"]}
{"doc_key": "8123883_2. Results", "text": ["\n2.1. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on the Cell Viability of hORSCs\nFirst, we examined whether MSCT could increase the cell viability of hORSCs. The concentration of hHMSCs used was 5 \u00d7 10 4  cells/well, according to a previous study [ 9 ]. To determine time-dependent effects, hORSCs were co-cultured with hHMSCs for 24 h and 48 h. Cell viability was estimated by MTT assays ( Figure 1 ). The results showed that treatment with hHMSCs enhanced hORSC viability at 24 h and 48 h. While IFN-gamma significantly decreased the cell viability of hORSCs, when co-cultured with hHMSCs, hORSC viability increased up to ~130% compared to the controls. Furthermore, MSCT upregulated hORSC viability in the IFN-gamma-pretreated group compared to the IFN-gamma-only treated group. This tendency was similar to that seen when hHMSCs were treated for 24 h and 48 h. In this study, we used 24 h for hHMSC and hORSC co-cultures in all experiments.\n2.2. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on NLRP3 Inflammasome Components\nTo investigate whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation was related to MSCT in hORSCs, we examined the expression of  NLRP3, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), caspase-1, and IL-1beta  at the mRNA levels. As shown in  Figure 2 ,  NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1beta  were significantly increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. There was no significant difference in the expression levels in the MSCT group compared to the controls, whereas the expression of inflammasome components was upregulated in the IFN-gamma-treated group, and downregulated by additional MSCT.\n2.3. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on HF-IP Collapse-Related Genes\nTo further investigate the association between anagen arrest and re-entry by MSCT in hORSCs, we examined the expression  of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, IFN-gammaR,  and Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related protein A (MICA) at the mRNA level ( Figure 3 ). As shown in  Figure 3 , the hair follicle immune privilege (HF-IP) collapse-related gene ( Figure 3 A-I) expression levels were significantly increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. The changes in expression were not significantly different following MSCT compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group, the expressions were suppressed by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the MSCT group. The expression level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine  IL-10  was upregulated by MSCT compared to the controls ( Figure 3 E). Changes in the expression of  IL-10  were not significant in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group,  IL-10  expression was increased by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSCs-treated group and the MSCT group.\n2.4. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway Molecules\nWe measured the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin genes by real-time PCR to investigate the roles of MSCT ( Figure 4 ). The results showed that MSCT significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of  WNT3, WNT5, WNT7, WNT10, GSK-3beta, beta-catenin ,  Cyclin D1, Lymphoid-enhancer factor-1 (LEF1)  and  AXIN2  compared to the controls. Additionally, IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group increased the mRNA expression levels of  WNT3, WNT5, WNT10, GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, Cyclin D1, LEF1  and  AXIN2 , which was decreased by IFN-gamma. The mRNA levels of  WNT7  were significantly increased only in the MSCT group.\nAs shown in  Figure 4 B, MSCT downregulated the expression levels of  DKK1  in the MSCT group with and without IFN-gamma treatment compared to the controls. The change in  TGF-beta2  expression was not significant in the MSCT group compared to the controls. The expression levels of  DKK1  and  TGF-beta2  were increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group and were suppressed by MSCT.\nWe also investigated the effects of MSCT on the WNT/beta-catenin pathway at the protein level by Western blotting ( Figure 5 ). The levels of beta-catenin and phosphorylation of GSK-3beta were increased in the MSCT group compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group, beta-catenin and the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta were upregulated by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the MSCT group. In contrast, the level of DKK1 was increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls, and DKK1 was significantly reverted by MSCT. The protein expressions were similar to the mRNA levels ( Figure 4 ).\n2.5. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on Hair Stem Cell Markers\nWe investigated the effects of MSCT on hair stem cell markers at the protein expression level ( Figure 5 ). Whereas the levels of SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9(SOX9), CD34, and CD200 were significantly decreased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls, their levels were significantly increased in the MSCT group compared to the controls. The expression of SOX9 and CD200 was upregulated by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the differences were statistically significant compared to the IFN-gamma-treated controls ( Figure 5 B). CD34 protein expression was increased by additional MSCT in the IFN-gamma-treated group, but the change was not significant ( Figure 5 ). We also measured the expression of  Keratin15  genes by qPCR ( Figure 5 C). The results showed that MSCT significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of  Keratin15  compared to the controls. Additionally, IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group increased the expression level of mRNA of  Keratin15 , which was decreased by IFN-gamma.\n2.6. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on Growth Factors\nNext, we examined the growth factors at the mRNA expression level. Insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1), fibroblast growth factor 2(FGF2), fibroblast growth factor 7(FGF7), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), and BMP4 are representative growth factors associated with hair growth.\nAs shown in  Figure 6 , the expression levels of FGF7, VEGF, and PDGF were significantly suppressed in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. The expression levels of IGF1, FGF2, SHH, BMP2 and BMP4 were suppressed by IFN-gamma treatment but the change was not significant compared to the controls. Interestingly, the levels of all growth factors including  IGF1, FGF2, FGF7, VEGF, PDGF, SHH, BMP2  and  BMP4  in response to MSCT were significantly upregulated compared to the control or IFN-gamma-treated groups in this study.\n2.7. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on the JAK/STAT Pathway\nWe examined the effects of MSCT on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway at the protein level using Western blotting ( Figure 7 ). Overall, the expression of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and STAT1, STAT2, STAT3 proteins in the IFN-gamma-treated group was upregulated compared to the controls, and phosphorylation and some total protein levels in the Western blots were downregulated by MSCT ( Figure 7 A).\nThe level of phosphorylation of JAK1-3 was significantly increased in IFN-gamma-treated cells compared to the controls. Phosphorylation was significantly suppressed by MSCT compared to the IFN-gamma-treated controls ( Figure 7 B). The levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were also increased by IFN-gamma treatment, and the expression of STAT1 phosphorylation was decreased by additional MSCT. Whereas the expression of STAT3 was suppressed by MSCT compared to controls, the change in IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group was not significant compared to both controls and IFN-gamma-treated group. The effect of IFN-gamma or MSCT on the expression of STAT2 was not remarkable.\nNext, we also investigated the effect of MSCT on IFN-gammaR and IL-15, which are the key cytokines in JAK/ STAT pathway activation. The level of IFN-gammaR was increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the control and was suppressed by MSCT. IL-15 was only expressed in the IFN-gamma-treated group and MSCT blocked the expression of IL-15 ( Figure 7 ).\n2.8. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on hORSC Migration Ability\nNext, the effect of MSCT on hORSC migration was examined by the crystal violet assay using six-well polycarbonate Transwell inserts. As shown in  Figure 8 , cell migration ability was decreased in the IFN-gamma-treated group but increased in the hHMSC co-culture group compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group, the migration ability of the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the hHMSC-only group was significantly increased. The quantitative determination of transferred cells is shown in  Figure 8 C.\n2.9. Effects of hHMSCs Treatment on the Mouse Vibrissa HF Organ Culture\nTo examine the effect of MSCT at the organ level, we performed an ex vivo culture of mouse vibrissae HFs. In this study, 20 HFs were cultured individually with control, IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma plus MSCT, or MSCT. Each hair shaft was measured every third day.\nAs shown in  Figure 9 , HFs and the hair shaft in the MSCT group grew longer than the control, and hair bulb structure was preserved at 10 days. The hair shaft of the IFN-gamma-treated group did not grow longer than control and the hair bulb was changed. We observed the hair separated from the follicle and the morphology of the hair bulb was curved, which are catagen-like regressive changes. The IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group also showed growth of the hair shaft compared to the control. Compared to the IFN-gamma treated group, the hair bulb of the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group was preserved and the hair shaft was longer.\n"], "ner": [[[481, 490, "GENE"], [692, 701, "GENE"], [735, 744, "GENE"]], [[1107, 1112, "GENE"], [1114, 1171, "GENE"], [1173, 1176, "GENE"], [1179, 1188, "GENE"], [1194, 1202, "GENE"], [1249, 1254, "GENE"], [1256, 1259, "GENE"], [1261, 1270, "GENE"], [1276, 1284, "GENE"], [1322, 1331, "GENE"], [1550, 1559, "GENE"]], [[1800, 1805, "GENE"], [1807, 1813, "GENE"], [1815, 1821, "GENE"], [1823, 1828, "GENE"], [1830, 1835, "GENE"], [1837, 1842, "GENE"], [1844, 1849, "GENE"], [1851, 1861, "GENE"], [1868, 1938, "GENE"], [1940, 1944, "GENE"], [2137, 2146, "GENE"], [2303, 2312, "GENE"], [2375, 2384, "GENE"], [2481, 2486, "GENE"], [2582, 2587, "GENE"], [2617, 2626, "GENE"], [2683, 2692, "GENE"], [2709, 2714, "GENE"], [2756, 2765, "GENE"]], [[3089, 3093, "GENE"], [3095, 3099, "GENE"], [3101, 3105, "GENE"], [3107, 3112, "GENE"], [3114, 3123, "GENE"], [3125, 3137, "GENE"], [3141, 3150, "GENE"], [3152, 3178, "GENE"], [3180, 3184, "GENE"], [3192, 3197, "GENE"], [3239, 3248, "GENE"], [3310, 3314, "GENE"], [3316, 3320, "GENE"], [3322, 3327, "GENE"], [3329, 3338, "GENE"], [3340, 3352, "GENE"], [3354, 3363, "GENE"], [3365, 3369, "GENE"], [3376, 3381, "GENE"], [3407, 3416, "GENE"], [3438, 3442, "GENE"]], [[3567, 3571, "GENE"], [3608, 3617, "GENE"], [3669, 3678, "GENE"], [3781, 3785, "GENE"], [3792, 3801, "GENE"], [3825, 3834, "GENE"]], [[4020, 4032, "GENE"], [4056, 4065, "GENE"], [4141, 4150, "GENE"], [4166, 4178, "GENE"], [4206, 4215, "GENE"], [4248, 4257, "GENE"], [4324, 4328, "GENE"], [4350, 4359, "GENE"], [4404, 4408, "GENE"]], [[4702, 4732, "GENE"], [4733, 4737, "GENE"], [4740, 4744, "GENE"], [4750, 4755, "GENE"], [4792, 4801, "GENE"], [4946, 4950, "GENE"], [4955, 4960, "GENE"], [4992, 5001, "GENE"], [5089, 5098, "GENE"], [5131, 5135, "GENE"], [5195, 5204, "GENE"], [5305, 5314, "GENE"], [5431, 5440, "GENE"], [5482, 5491, "GENE"], [5555, 5564, "GENE"], [5590, 5599, "GENE"]], [[5717, 5745, "GENE"], [5746, 5750, "GENE"], [5753, 5779, "GENE"], [5780, 5784, "GENE"], [5787, 5813, "GENE"], [5814, 5818, "GENE"], [5821, 5855, "GENE"], [5857, 5861, "GENE"], [5864, 5894, "GENE"], [5896, 5900, "GENE"], [5903, 5917, "GENE"], [5919, 5922, "GENE"], [5925, 5953, "GENE"], [5955, 5959, "GENE"], [5966, 5970, "GENE"]], [[6083, 6087, "GENE"], [6089, 6093, "GENE"], [6099, 6103, "GENE"], [6141, 6150, "GENE"], [6216, 6220, "GENE"], [6222, 6226, "GENE"], [6228, 6231, "GENE"], [6233, 6237, "GENE"], [6242, 6246, "GENE"], [6266, 6275, "GENE"], [6406, 6410, "GENE"], [6412, 6416, "GENE"], [6418, 6422, "GENE"], [6424, 6428, "GENE"], [6430, 6434, "GENE"], [6436, 6439, "GENE"], [6441, 6445, "GENE"], [6452, 6456, "GENE"], [6536, 6545, "GENE"]], [[6782, 6786, "GENE"], [6788, 6792, "GENE"], [6794, 6798, "GENE"], [6803, 6808, "GENE"], [6810, 6815, "GENE"], [6817, 6822, "GENE"], [6839, 6848, "GENE"]], [[7050, 7054, "GENE"], [7088, 7097, "GENE"], [7207, 7216, "GENE"], [7278, 7283, "GENE"], [7288, 7293, "GENE"], [7317, 7326, "GENE"], [7360, 7365, "GENE"], [7442, 7447, "GENE"], [7507, 7516, "GENE"], [7587, 7596, "GENE"], [7626, 7635, "GENE"], [7665, 7670, "GENE"]], [[7740, 7750, "GENE"], [7755, 7760, "GENE"], [7836, 7846, "GENE"], [7868, 7877, "GENE"], [7944, 7949, "GENE"], [7976, 7985, "GENE"]], [[8314, 8323, "GENE"], [8424, 8433, "GENE"], [8478, 8487, "GENE"]], [[8880, 8889, "GENE"], [8891, 8900, "GENE"]], [[9134, 9143, "GENE"], [9366, 9375, "GENE"], [9520, 9529, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], "sentences": ["\n2.1.

Effect of hHMSC Treatment on NLRP3 Inflammasome Components\nTo investigate whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation was related to MSCT in hORSCs, we examined the expression of  NLRP3, Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), caspase-1, and IL-1beta  at the mRNA levels. As shown in  Figure 2 ,  NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1beta  were significantly increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. There was no significant difference in the expression levels in the MSCT group compared to the controls, whereas the expression of inflammasome components was upregulated in the IFN-gamma-treated group, and downregulated by additional MSCT.\n", "2.3. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on HF-IP Collapse-Related Genes\nTo further investigate the association between anagen arrest and re-entry by MSCT in hORSCs, we examined the expression  of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, IFN-gammaR,  and Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related protein A (MICA) at the mRNA level ( Figure 3 ). As shown in  Figure 3 , the hair follicle immune privilege (HF-IP) collapse-related gene ( Figure 3 A-I) expression levels were significantly increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. The changes in expression were not significantly different following MSCT compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group, the expressions were suppressed by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the MSCT group. The expression level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine  IL-10  was upregulated by MSCT compared to the controls ( Figure 3 E). Changes in the expression of  IL-10  were not significant in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group,  IL-10  expression was increased by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSCs-treated group and the MSCT group.\n", "2.4. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway Molecules\nWe measured the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin genes by real-time PCR to investigate the roles of MSCT ( Figure 4 ). The results showed that MSCT significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of  WNT3, WNT5, WNT7, WNT10, GSK-3beta, beta-catenin ,  Cyclin D1, Lymphoid-enhancer factor-1 (LEF1)  and  AXIN2  compared to the controls. Additionally, IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group increased the mRNA expression levels of  WNT3, WNT5, WNT10, GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, Cyclin D1, LEF1  and  AXIN2 , which was decreased by IFN-gamma. The mRNA levels of  WNT7  were significantly increased only in the MSCT group.\n", "As shown in  Figure 4 B, MSCT downregulated the expression levels of  DKK1  in the MSCT group with and without IFN-gamma treatment compared to the controls. The change in  TGF-beta2  expression was not significant in the MSCT group compared to the controls. The expression levels of  DKK1  and  TGF-beta2  were increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group and were suppressed by MSCT.\n", "We also investigated the effects of MSCT on the WNT/beta-catenin pathway at the protein level by Western blotting ( Figure 5 ). The levels of beta-catenin and phosphorylation of GSK-3beta were increased in the MSCT group compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group, beta-catenin and the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta were upregulated by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the MSCT group. In contrast, the level of DKK1 was increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls, and DKK1 was significantly reverted by MSCT. The protein expressions were similar to the mRNA levels ( Figure 4 ).\n", "2.5. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on Hair Stem Cell Markers\nWe investigated the effects of MSCT on hair stem cell markers at the protein expression level ( Figure 5 ). Whereas the levels of SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9(SOX9), CD34, and CD200 were significantly decreased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls, their levels were significantly increased in the MSCT group compared to the controls. The expression of SOX9 and CD200 was upregulated by MSCT in the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the differences were statistically significant compared to the IFN-gamma-treated controls ( Figure 5 B). CD34 protein expression was increased by additional MSCT in the IFN-gamma-treated group, but the change was not significant ( Figure 5 ). We also measured the expression of  Keratin15  genes by qPCR ( Figure 5 C). The results showed that MSCT significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of  Keratin15  compared to the controls. Additionally, IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group increased the expression level of mRNA of  Keratin15 , which was decreased by IFN-gamma.\n", "2.6. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on Growth Factors\nNext, we examined the growth factors at the mRNA expression level. Insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF1), fibroblast growth factor 2(FGF2), fibroblast growth factor 7(FGF7), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), and BMP4 are representative growth factors associated with hair growth.\n", "As shown in  Figure 6 , the expression levels of FGF7, VEGF, and PDGF were significantly suppressed in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the controls. The expression levels of IGF1, FGF2, SHH, BMP2 and BMP4 were suppressed by IFN-gamma treatment but the change was not significant compared to the controls. Interestingly, the levels of all growth factors including  IGF1, FGF2, FGF7, VEGF, PDGF, SHH, BMP2  and  BMP4  in response to MSCT were significantly upregulated compared to the control or IFN-gamma-treated groups in this study.\n", "2.7. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on the JAK/STAT Pathway\nWe examined the effects of MSCT on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway at the protein level using Western blotting ( Figure 7 ). Overall, the expression of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and STAT1, STAT2, STAT3 proteins in the IFN-gamma-treated group was upregulated compared to the controls, and phosphorylation and some total protein levels in the Western blots were downregulated by MSCT ( Figure 7 A).\n", "The level of phosphorylation of JAK1-3 was significantly increased in IFN-gamma-treated cells compared to the controls. Phosphorylation was significantly suppressed by MSCT compared to the IFN-gamma-treated controls ( Figure 7 B). The levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were also increased by IFN-gamma treatment, and the expression of STAT1 phosphorylation was decreased by additional MSCT. Whereas the expression of STAT3 was suppressed by MSCT compared to controls, the change in IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group was not significant compared to both controls and IFN-gamma-treated group. The effect of IFN-gamma or MSCT on the expression of STAT2 was not remarkable.\n", "Next, we also investigated the effect of MSCT on IFN-gammaR and IL-15, which are the key cytokines in JAK/ STAT pathway activation. The level of IFN-gammaR was increased in the IFN-gamma-treated group compared to the control and was suppressed by MSCT. IL-15 was only expressed in the IFN-gamma-treated group and MSCT blocked the expression of IL-15 ( Figure 7 ).\n", "2.8. Effect of hHMSC Treatment on hORSC Migration Ability\nNext, the effect of MSCT on hORSC migration was examined by the crystal violet assay using six-well polycarbonate Transwell inserts. As shown in  Figure 8 , cell migration ability was decreased in the IFN-gamma-treated group but increased in the hHMSC co-culture group compared to the controls. Compared to the IFN-gamma-treated group, the migration ability of the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group and the hHMSC-only group was significantly increased. The quantitative determination of transferred cells is shown in  Figure 8 C.\n", "2.9. Effects of hHMSCs Treatment on the Mouse Vibrissa HF Organ Culture\nTo examine the effect of MSCT at the organ level, we performed an ex vivo culture of mouse vibrissae HFs. In this study, 20 HFs were cultured individually with control, IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma plus MSCT, or MSCT. Each hair shaft was measured every third day.\n", "As shown in  Figure 9 , HFs and the hair shaft in the MSCT group grew longer than the control, and hair bulb structure was preserved at 10 days. The hair shaft of the IFN-gamma-treated group did not grow longer than control and the hair bulb was changed. We observed the hair separated from the follicle and the morphology of the hair bulb was curved, which are catagen-like regressive changes. The IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group also showed growth of the hair shaft compared to the control. Compared to the IFN-gamma treated group, the hair bulb of the IFN-gamma-hHMSC-treated group was preserved and the hair shaft was longer.\n"]}

{"doc_key": "8123883_1. Introduction", "text": ["\nAlopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that targets hair follicles (HFs) during the anagen stage and is primarily caused by the disruption of immune privilege. [ 1 , 2 ]. AA is characterized by unexpected hair loss [ 3 , 4 ]. Even though AA is not a serious, life-threatening illness, it can have psychological consequences, including high levels of depression and anxiety [ 1 , 2 ]. However, the pathological mechanisms of chronic AA and alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis hair loss are not fully understood. Many patients with alopecia totalis and alopecia totalis show tolerance to conventional treatments [ 5 ].\nAccording to the concept of pathology, the prevention or recovery of immune privilege disruption of HFs can ultimately lead to the more effective management of AA. Recently, research studies have reported that treatments using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be useful for treating AA. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy (MSCT) or stem cell therapy using umbilical cord blood-derived cells for AA has been reported in several refractory cases [ 6 , 7 ]. A recent study examined the effects of MSCT in AA mouse models and discovered the immunomodulatory effects of MSCT. MSCT inhibited the expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), C-X-C motif chemokines (CXCL) 9 and 10, and T-cell infiltration around HFs in AA mice [ 8 ].\nThe mechanism by which MSCT is associated with improvement of hair growth and the immune environment is not yet well known. According to our previous study, MSCT reverted an AA-like environment in human dermal papillar cells (hDPCs) via the Wnt/beta-catenin and Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription protein (STAT) signaling pathways. In addition, various growth factors and cytokines associated with anagen re-entry induction were found to be enhanced by MSCT [ 9 ]. Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT signaling pathways is known to upregulate genes responsible for cell differentiation, proliferation, and anagen reentry in HFs [ 10 , 11 ]. MSCT was found to prolong anagen re-entry through activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT signaling pathways [ 9 ].\nHFs are composed of cells of multiple origins, are single independent mini-organs, and have a characteristic periodic hair cycle [ 12 ]. The hair starts anew by the interaction between hDPC and hORSC signals. Additionally, some hORSCs contain HF stem cells, which are important for the initiation of the hair cycle.\nThe hORSCs of HFs are multilayered tissues predominantly made up of undifferentiated keratinocytes [ 13 ]. hORSCs mainly comprise the hair shaft and the hair matrix. They play important roles in maintaining hDPCs and hair matrix cells [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ]. They also contribute to the formation of HFs and the epidermis. hORSC apoptosis, which influences cell degeneration, the catagen phase of HFs, and upregulates the levels of necrosis and apoptosis in HFs, is associated with AA [ 18 ]. hORSCs also regulate inflammatory responses by expressing NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) [ 19 ].\nThe effects of MSCT on hORSCs have not yet been studied. To study the therapeutic mechanism of MSCT in AA, we investigated the effect of MSCT on hORSCs, with or without pretreatment with IFN-gamma. We examined the effect of MSCT on the viability and migration ability of hORSCs. We focused on the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT signaling pathways and changes associated with the expression of several cytokines and chemokines, inflammasomes, growth factors, hair stem cell markers, and migration in response to MSCT.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 16, "DISEASE"], [18, 20, "DISEASE"], [179, 181, "DISEASE"], [246, 248, "DISEASE"], [440, 442, "DISEASE"], [447, 463, "DISEASE"], [467, 487, "DISEASE"], [543, 559, "DISEASE"], [564, 580, "DISEASE"]], [[790, 792, "DISEASE"], [914, 916, "DISEASE"], [1021, 1023, "DISEASE"], [1128, 1130, "DISEASE"], [1248, 1257, "GENE"], [1338, 1340, "DISEASE"]], [[1527, 1529, "DISEASE"]], [], [[2962, 2964, "DISEASE"]], [[3187, 3189, "DISEASE"], [3271, 3280, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "sentences": ["\nAlopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that targets hair follicles (HFs) during the anagen stage and is primarily caused by the disruption of immune privilege.

{"doc_key": "4636297_Results", "text": ["\nDual inhibition of PI3K/Akt and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by SMA in colon cancer cells\nThe hyperproliferation of colonic epithelium is one of the earliest changes observed during the tumorigenesis of CRC [ 27 , 28 ]. We investigated whether SMA suppresses colon cancer proliferation by using a colony formation assay in HT29 cells, which possess an  APC  mutation, and CT26 cells, which do not. SMA significantly inhibited colony formation by colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig 1A ). In the cell proliferation assay, the IC 50  (50% maximal inhibitory concentration) of SMA was lower in CT26 cells than in HT29 cells ( Table 1 ). However, the inhibitory effect of SMA at concentrations above 10 \u03bcM was greater in HT29 cells than in CT26 cells ( Fig 1B ). In HT29 colon cancer cells, as we previously reported in endothelial cells, phosphorylation of PI3K and its downstream signals, Akt and mTOR phosphorylation, were blocked by SMA ( Fig 1C ). However, 50 \u03bcM SMA did not suppress Akt phosphorylation completely to the vehicle-treated control level. Because SMA at the same concentration completely suppressed colony formation, the results imply that PI3K/Akt signaling was not the only pathway mediating the inhibitory action of SMA against colon cancer cell proliferation. To identify other possible signaling pathways mediating the anti-proliferative action of SMA, we examined the involvement of beta-catenin, which is associated with CRC tumorigenesis, in SMA action. The beta-catenin level is regulated by GSK3beta, which is inhibited by PI3K/Akt. Treatment with GSK3beta inhibitors, BIO or LiCl, under serum-starved conditions, induced the proliferations of colon cancer cells, CT26, HT29, and HCT116. These cell proliferations were suppressed by SMA ( Fig 1D and 1E ). The IC 50  of SMA in BIO- or LiCl-induced cell proliferation was higher than in serum-induced proliferation ( Table 1 ).\n\n           10.1371/journal.pone.0141753.t001 \n           Table 1 \n           50 ) of SMA in cancer cell proliferation.

Immunofluorescence staining with anti-beta-catenin antibody and confocal microscopy demonstrated that cytosolic beta-catenin was highly translocated to the nucleus after stimulation with serum ( Fig 2A ) or Wnt3\u03b1 ( Fig 2B ) in HT29 cells. This nuclear translocation was significantly suppressed by SMA. In addition, Western blot analysis also demonstrated that serum-induced nuclear beta-catenin accumulation was significantly suppressed by SMA. In fact, nuclear beta-catenin was not detectable at SMA concentrations of 10 or 50 \u03bcM ( Fig 2C ). In addition, total cellular beta-catenin levels were decreased by SMA. Given that nuclear beta-catenin binds to members of the TCF/LEF1 family of transcriptional factors to induce target gene expressions, we examined the effects of SMA on TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity using a TCF/LEF reporter gene dual-luciferase assay. Treating reporter gene-transfected cells with SMA significantly inhibited Wnt3\u03b1 (10 ng/mL)- or serum-enhanced TCF/LEF transcription activities ( Fig 2D ). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of beta-catenin/TCF/LEF target gene expressions showed that SMA significantly suppressed the expressions of cyclin D1 and c-myc in HT29 cells ( Fig 2E ).\nEffect of SMA on tankyrase enzyme activity, axin levels, and beta-catenin destruction complex\nThe SMA-induced decrease in total beta-catenin levels suggests that SMA enhances the activity of the beta-catenin destruction complex. In fact, SMA increased the level of the phosphorylated form of beta-catenin ( Fig 3A ). This increase in beta-catenin phosphorylation in SMA-treated cells may have been achieved by increased GSK3beta activity due to suppression of PI3K/Akt activity or by increased levels of tankyrase-regulated axin proteins. As expected, there was an inhibitory effect of SMA on PI3K/Akt, and SMA suppressed GSK3beta phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig 3A ). At the same time, SMA increased axin1 and axin2 levels ( Fig 3A ). Because axin levels are regulated by tankyrase, we also investigated whether increased axin levels in SMA-treated cells were due to tankyrase inhibition by comparing the effect of SMA to the effect of XAV939, which is a selective and potent tankyrase inhibitor. SMA showed a low level of inhibition of tankyrase enzyme activity (IC 50  of 50.1 \u03bcM and 15.5 \u03bcM for tankyrase 1 and 2, respectively) compared to XAV939 ( Fig 3B  and  Table 2 ). However, SMA strongly inhibited TCF/LEF transcription activity to almost the same extent as XAV939 ( Fig 3C ). The IC 50  values of SMA and XAV939 on TCF/LEF transcription activity were 39.8 nM and 28.1 nM, respectively ( Table 2 ).\n\n           10.1371/journal.pone.0141753.t002 \n           Table 2 \n           50  of SMA with respect to tankyrase and TCF/LEF transcription activities.

In the CT26 syngenic tumor model, SMA dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth in a manner similar to 5-FU ( Fig 4B and 4C ). However, 5-FU at 50 mg/kg showed obvious toxic effects, such as hair loss and significant body weight reduction at the fourth day of treatment ( Fig 4D ). Unlike 5-FU, SMA at the same dose did not produce such changes. Similarly, in the HT29 xenograft tumor model, SMA was found to have a dose-dependent anti-tumor effect ( Fig 4E ). In addition, when SMA (50 mg/kg) was administered with low dose 5-FU (10 mg/kg), the effects were greater than those of 5-FU (10 mg/kg) or SMA (50 mg/kg) alone ( Fig 4D ), and SMA did not reduce body weight ( Fig 4F ).\nAnti-tumor effect of SMA alone and in combination with cisplatin in the A549 lung cancer xenograft model\nNext, we examined whether SMA could exert anti-proliferative activity in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC), which possess mutant APC and wild type beta-catenin similar to HT29 colon cancer cells. Treatment with SMA inhibited A549 human lung cancer cell proliferation ( Fig 1 ), and the IC 50  value of SMA against serum- or GSK3beta inhibitor-induced cancer cell proliferation was the lowest in A549 cells ( Table 1 ). The anti-tumor effect and action mechanism of SMA were further examined in a mouse tumor model with a xenograft of A549 cells (drug treatment scheme is shown in  Fig 5A ). As shown in  Fig 5B , SMA significantly suppressed tumor growth in this model. Because cisplatin is often the first treatment option for monotherapy or for combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, we also compared the effect of SMA with cisplatin. In the A549 xenograft model, 50 mg/kg SMA had an anti-tumor effect similar to 1 mg/kg cisplatin. Furthermore, combined therapy with cisplatin (1 mg/kg) and SMA (50 mg/kg) had a much stronger anti-tumor effect than cisplatin or SMA alone ( Fig 5B and 5C ). Western blot analyses of tumor tissues showed SMA significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of PI3K (p85), Akt, and GSK3beta ( Fig 5D ). In contrast, axin levels were increased by SMA. Cisplatin treatment induced a similar but less potent effect on the phosphorylation of the signaling proteins.

Nuclear beta-catenin levels in tumor tissues were not inhibited by cisplatin alone, but were dramatically suppressed by SMA and synergistically by SMA plus cisplatin ( Fig 5E ).

We investigated whether SMA suppresses colon cancer proliferation by using a colony formation assay in HT29 cells, which possess an  APC  mutation, and CT26 cells, which do not. SMA significantly inhibited colony formation by colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig 1A ). In the cell proliferation assay, the IC 50  (50% maximal inhibitory concentration) of SMA was lower in CT26 cells than in HT29 cells ( Table 1 ). However, the inhibitory effect of SMA at concentrations above 10 \u03bcM was greater in HT29 cells than in CT26 cells ( Fig 1B ). In HT29 colon cancer cells, as we previously reported in endothelial cells, phosphorylation of PI3K and its downstream signals, Akt and mTOR phosphorylation, were blocked by SMA ( Fig 1C ). However, 50 \u03bcM SMA did not suppress Akt phosphorylation completely to the vehicle-treated control level. Because SMA at the same concentration completely suppressed colony formation, the results imply that PI3K/Akt signaling was not the only pathway mediating the inhibitory action of SMA against colon cancer cell proliferation. To identify other possible signaling pathways mediating the anti-proliferative action of SMA, we examined the involvement of beta-catenin, which is associated with CRC tumorigenesis, in SMA action. The beta-catenin level is regulated by GSK3beta, which is inhibited by PI3K/Akt. Treatment with GSK3beta inhibitors, BIO or LiCl, under serum-starved conditions, induced the proliferations of colon cancer cells, CT26, HT29, and HCT116. These cell proliferations were suppressed by SMA ( Fig 1D and 1E ). The IC 50  of SMA in BIO- or LiCl-induced cell proliferation was higher than in serum-induced proliferation ( Table 1 ).\n", "\n           10.1371/journal.pone.0141753.t001 \n           Table 1 \n           50 ) of SMA in cancer cell proliferation.

Immunofluorescence staining with anti-beta-catenin antibody and confocal microscopy demonstrated that cytosolic beta-catenin was highly translocated to the nucleus after stimulation with serum ( Fig 2A ) or Wnt3\u03b1 ( Fig 2B ) in HT29 cells. This nuclear translocation was significantly suppressed by SMA. In addition, Western blot analysis also demonstrated that serum-induced nuclear beta-catenin accumulation was significantly suppressed by SMA. In fact, nuclear beta-catenin was not detectable at SMA concentrations of 10 or 50 \u03bcM ( Fig 2C ). In addition, total cellular beta-catenin levels were decreased by SMA. Given that nuclear beta-catenin binds to members of the TCF/LEF1 family of transcriptional factors to induce target gene expressions, we examined the effects of SMA on TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity using a TCF/LEF reporter gene dual-luciferase assay. Treating reporter gene-transfected cells with SMA significantly inhibited Wnt3\u03b1 (10 ng/mL)- or serum-enhanced TCF/LEF transcription activities ( Fig 2D ). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of beta-catenin/TCF/LEF target gene expressions showed that SMA significantly suppressed the expressions of cyclin D1 and c-myc in HT29 cells ( Fig 2E ).\n", "Effect of SMA on tankyrase enzyme activity, axin levels, and beta-catenin destruction complex\nThe SMA-induced decrease in total beta-catenin levels suggests that SMA enhances the activity of the beta-catenin destruction complex. In fact, SMA increased the level of the phosphorylated form of beta-catenin ( Fig 3A ). This increase in beta-catenin phosphorylation in SMA-treated cells may have been achieved by increased GSK3beta activity due to suppression of PI3K/Akt activity or by increased levels of tankyrase-regulated axin proteins. As expected, there was an inhibitory effect of SMA on PI3K/Akt, and SMA suppressed GSK3beta phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig 3A ). At the same time, SMA increased axin1 and axin2 levels ( Fig 3A ). Because axin levels are regulated by tankyrase, we also investigated whether increased axin levels in SMA-treated cells were due to tankyrase inhibition by comparing the effect of SMA to the effect of XAV939, which is a selective and potent tankyrase inhibitor. SMA showed a low level of inhibition of tankyrase enzyme activity (IC 50  of 50.1 \u03bcM and 15.5 \u03bcM for tankyrase 1 and 2, respectively) compared to XAV939 ( Fig 3B  and  Table 2 ). However, SMA strongly inhibited TCF/LEF transcription activity to almost the same extent as XAV939 ( Fig 3C ). The IC 50  values of SMA and XAV939 on TCF/LEF transcription activity were 39.8 nM and 28.1 nM, respectively ( Table 2 ).\n", "\n           10.1371/journal.pone.0141753.t002 \n           Table 2 \n           50  of SMA with respect to tankyrase and TCF/LEF transcription activities.

In the CT26 syngenic tumor model, SMA dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth in a manner similar to 5-FU ( Fig 4B and 4C ). However, 5-FU at 50 mg/kg showed obvious toxic effects, such as hair loss and significant body weight reduction at the fourth day of treatment ( Fig 4D ). Unlike 5-FU, SMA at the same dose did not produce such changes. Similarly, in the HT29 xenograft tumor model, SMA was found to have a dose-dependent anti-tumor effect ( Fig 4E ). In addition, when SMA (50 mg/kg) was administered with low dose 5-FU (10 mg/kg), the effects were greater than those of 5-FU (10 mg/kg) or SMA (50 mg/kg) alone ( Fig 4D ), and SMA did not reduce body weight ( Fig 4F ).\n", "Anti-tumor effect of SMA alone and in combination with cisplatin in the A549 lung cancer xenograft model\nNext, we examined whether SMA could exert anti-proliferative activity in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC), which possess mutant APC and wild type beta-catenin similar to HT29 colon cancer cells. Treatment with SMA inhibited A549 human lung cancer cell proliferation ( Fig 1 ), and the IC 50  value of SMA against serum- or GSK3beta inhibitor-induced cancer cell proliferation was the lowest in A549 cells ( Table 1 ). The anti-tumor effect and action mechanism of SMA were further examined in a mouse tumor model with a xenograft of A549 cells (drug treatment scheme is shown in  Fig 5A ). As shown in  Fig 5B , SMA significantly suppressed tumor growth in this model. Because cisplatin is often the first treatment option for monotherapy or for combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, we also compared the effect of SMA with cisplatin. In the A549 xenograft model, 50 mg/kg SMA had an anti-tumor effect similar to 1 mg/kg cisplatin. Furthermore, combined therapy with cisplatin (1 mg/kg) and SMA (50 mg/kg) had a much stronger anti-tumor effect than cisplatin or SMA alone ( Fig 5B and 5C ). Western blot analyses of tumor tissues showed SMA significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of PI3K (p85), Akt, and GSK3beta ( Fig 5D ). In contrast, axin levels were increased by SMA. Cisplatin treatment induced a similar but less potent effect on the phosphorylation of the signaling proteins. SMA in a combination regimen with cisplatin induced strong inhibitory effects on the signaling molecules. Nuclear beta-catenin levels in tumor tissues were not inhibited by cisplatin alone, but were dramatically suppressed by SMA and synergistically by SMA plus cisplatin ( Fig 5E ). Regarding c-Myc and cyclin D1 levels, although cisplatin suppressed their nuclear levels, treatment with SMA plus cisplatin had a much stronger effect ( Fig 5F ).\n"]}

HT29 cells were grown in RPMI1640 (Hyclone), whereas the CT26, A549, and HCT116 cell lines were grown in DMEM (Hyclone). Media was supplemented with 10% FBS containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a tissue culture incubator containing a 5% CO 2 /95% air atmosphere. After reaching confluence, the cells were trypsinized and sub-cultured by splitting the cells at a ratio of 1:5.\nProliferation assay\nCells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5000 cells/well, starved by culturing in 1% FBS overnight, and treated with SMA with or without 10% FBS, BIO (0.1 \u03bcM), or LiCl (10 mM) for 48 h.

Total cytosolic and nuclear proteins were extracted from cells and tissues and subjected to a western blot as previously described [ 26 ].\nNuclear translocation of beta-catenin\nThe cells were grown on confocal dishes (glass bottomed dishes; Ibidi). Overnight serum starved cells were pretreated with SMA, stimulated with Wnt3\u03b1 (10 ng/mL) or serum for 3 h, washed, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to reduce nonspecific binding, incubated with beta-catenin antibody (1:100, Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated with a secondary antibody-conjugated with FITC (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 600 nM 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and then the cells were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cells were observed and photographed using a Confocal A1 Imaging System (Nikon, Japan). Between each of the steps, the cells were washed with Tris Buffered Saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST).\nTCF/LEF reporter dual-luciferase assay\nThe cells were grown on confocal dishes (glass bottomed dishes; Ibidi). Overnight serum starved cells were pretreated with SMA, stimulated with Wnt3\u03b1 (10 ng/mL) or serum for 3 h, washed, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to reduce nonspecific binding, incubated with beta-catenin antibody (1:100, Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then incubated with a secondary antibody-conjugated with FITC (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclear staining was conducted using 600 nM 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and the cells were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cells were observed and photographed using an A1 Confocal Laser Microscope System (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Between each step, the cells were washed with Tris Buffered Saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST).\nTankyrase activity assay\nTo determine the effect of SMA on tankyrase 1 activity, the Tankyrase 1 Colorimetric Activity Assay Kit (Trivegen # 4700-096-K) was used. SMA was diluted in 1X I-PAR assay buffer (PAB). Histones from a histone-coated natural strip well plate were rehydrated with 50 \u03bcl of PAB and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 30 min. The PAB was removed and 25 \u03bcl of the assay cocktail, which consisted of 15 \u03bcl of the assay substrate and 10 \u03bcl of PAB with or without the inhibitor, was added to the samples. Tankyrase 1 enzyme (25 \u03bcl; 5 mUnits/well) was added to each well, and the tankyrase activities were determined using the Tankyrase 1 Colorimetric Activity Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nThe effect of SMA on Tankyrase 2 activity was screened using TNKS2 Histone Ribosylation Colorimetric Assay Kit (Bioscience #80583, San Diego, CA). The assay was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the transparent 96 well plate was coated with the histone proteins and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. A master mixture containing 10X PARP assay buffer, 10X PARP assay mixture and distilled water was prepared and added in all the wells except in substrate control where 10X PARP assay mixture was substituted by distilled water. 5 \u03bcl of SMA diluted in PBS were added to the designated wells at the indicated concentration. Then, the biotinylated NAD+ substrate was incubated with an assay buffer containing the TNKS2 enzyme. Finally, the streptavidin-HRP was added followed by the the colorimetric HRP substrate. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 2M H 2 SO 4 . The produced color was then measured at 450 nm using Spectrostar Nano microplate reader (BMG LABTECH).\nAnti-tumor activity measurements in mouse tumor models\nSix-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from Orient Co. Ltd, Korea and housed under pathogen-free conditions in a 12-h light/dark cycle with access to food pellets and tap water  ad libitum . The anti-tumor activities of MA and SMA were evaluated using an allograft (CT26 mouse colon carcinoma cell line) model and xenograft (HT29 human colon cancer and A549 human lung cancer cell line) models. Six mice per each group were used. In the allograft mouse model, the mice were injected subcutaneously with 5\u00d710 6  CT26 cells in 200 \u03bcl of DMEM/matrigel (1:1) into the flank region. Tumor sizes were measured every two days and calculated using following formula:\n V ( mm 3 ) = L \u00d7 W \u00d7 W \u00d7 \u00bd \n\nWhen tumors reached 100 mm 3 , the mice were divided into different groups and treatments were started by injecting drugs i.p. daily. Mice were monitored for physical conditions such as body weight change and rustling behavior every day. When one mouse in 5-FU-treated group died after 7 days of 5-FU (50 mg/kg) treatment in the allograft tumor study, we ended this experiment, which was earlier than we planned. At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed by placing them in a CO 2  gas-filled chamber, and the excised tumors were measured and weighed.

{"doc_key": "4636297_Introduction", "text": ["\nConstitutive activation of PI3K signaling is one of the most frequent gene mutations in human cancer [ 1 , 2 ] and results in the activation of the downstream signaling molecule Akt, which signals cell proliferation and survival. In colorectal cancer (CRC),  PIK3CA , which encodes PI3K catalytic alpha polypeptide, is frequently amplified or mutated. Because the mutated PIK3CA plays an important role in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism,  PIK3CA  is suggested as a therapeutic target in CRC [ 3 ]. Additionally, inappropriate activation of the Wnt pathway has also been observed in CRC as well as many other cancers [ 4 - 6 ]. This Wnt pathway activation results in the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and the modulation of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activity to promote cell proliferation [ 7 ]. The two signaling pathways of PI3K/Akt and Wnt/beta-catenin cross-talk through glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). GSK3beta is a component of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which also includes axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and casein kinase 1. In the absence of Wnt, beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3beta and undergoes proteosomal degradation. In the presence of Wnt, the activated Frizzled receptor with Dishevelled disrupts assembly of the beta-catenin destruction complex, and beta-catenin is stabilized in the cytosol [ 8 ]. Additionally, phosphorylation of GSK3beta by PI3K/Akt in the presence of growth factors results in the inhibition of GSK3beta kinase activity [ 9 - 11 ], which leads to stabilization of beta-catenin. Therefore, beta-catenin phosphorylation and degradation via GSK3beta activation constitute one of the anti-cancer action mechanisms of PI3K/Akt inhibitors. In addition, axin, by acting as a beta-catenin scaffold protein, regulates the efficiency of the beta-catenin destruction complex [ 12 ]. GSK3beta is stably bound to axin, which is the least abundant core component of the beta-catenin destruction complex [ 12 - 14 ]. Furthermore, GSK3beta binding of axin directs axin to target beta-catenin and shields GSK3beta from the action of Akt [ 15 ]. The axin levels are regulated by tankyrase, which induces axin ubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation. Studies with XAV939, a selective and potent tankyrase inhibitor, have demonstrated that it stabilizes axin levels and promotes beta-catenin destruction [ 16 , 17 ]. It has also been reported tankyrase 1 is overexpressed in a variety of cancers [ 18 - 20 ], and XAV939 has been shown to be an effective anti-cancer agent for CRC and other cancers [ 21 ]. Furthermore, the inhibition of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway by tankyrase inhibitors enhances the efficacy of EGFR inhibitor for the treatment of lung cancer [ 22 ], which suggests that tankyrase inhibitors could be used as adjuvant cancer treatments.\nMacrolides have numerous biological activities, including the modulation of inflammation [ 23 ] and of the proliferation of B16-F10 murine melanoma cells [ 24 ]. In a previous study, we reported that the 7- O -succinyl derivative of macrolactin A (SMA) inhibits class I PI3K enzyme activity and its downstream signaling pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6k,  in vitro  and  in vivo  [ 25 ]. In the present study, we report that SMA inhibits tankyrase in addition to inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, the study demonstrates that this dual inhibitory effect of SMA effectively suppresses the nuclear beta-catenin level and TCF/LEF transcriptional activity  in vitro  and in a mouse xenograft tumor model.\n"], "ner": [[[95, 101, "DISEASE"], [179, 182, "GENE"], [234, 251, "DISEASE"], [253, 256, "DISEASE"], [260, 266, "GENE"], [283, 315, "GENE"], [344, 351, "RELATION"], [365, 372, "RELATION"], [373, 379, "GENE"], [389, 403, "RELATION"], [407, 413, "DISEASE"], [461, 467, "GENE"], [487, 505, "RELATION"], [509, 512, "DISEASE"], [604, 607, "DISEASE"], [630, 636, "DISEASE"], [946, 976, "GENE"], [978, 986, "GENE"], [989, 997, "GENE"], [1020, 1032, "GENE"], [1074, 1078, "GENE"], [1080, 1106, "GENE"], [1108, 1111, "GENE"], [1118, 1133, "GENE"], [1158, 1170, "GENE"], [1192, 1200, "GENE"], [1338, 1350, "GENE"], [1376, 1388, "GENE"], [1458, 1466, "GENE"], [1470, 1474, "GENE"], [1475, 1478, "GENE"], [1542, 1550, "GENE"], [1611, 1623, "GENE"], [1636, 1648, "GENE"], [1685, 1693, "GENE"], [1732, 1738, "DISEASE"], [1760, 1764, "GENE"], [1765, 1768, "GENE"], [1794, 1798, "GENE"], [1815, 1827, "GENE"], [1878, 1890, "GENE"], [1919, 1927, "GENE"], [1947, 1951, "GENE"], [2003, 2015, "GENE"], [2062, 2070, "GENE"], [2082, 2086, "GENE"], [2110, 2122, "GENE"], [2135, 2143, "GENE"], [2163, 2166, "GENE"], [2179, 2183, "GENE"], [2208, 2217, "GENE"], [2233, 2237, "GENE"], [2328, 2337, "GENE"], [2386, 2390, "GENE"], [2411, 2423, "GENE"], [2475, 2484, "GENE"], [2490, 2503, "RELATION"], [2520, 2526, "DISEASE"], [2591, 2597, "DISEASE"], [2608, 2611, "DISEASE"], [2622, 2628, "DISEASE"], [2823, 2832, "GENE"], [2870, 2876, "DISEASE"]], [[3028, 3036, "DISEASE"], [3093, 3135, "GENE"], [3323, 3332, "GENE"], [3489, 3501, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[[260, 266, 234, 251, "associated mutation"], [260, 266, 253, 256, "associated mutation"], [283, 315, 234, 251, "associated mutation"], [283, 315, 253, 256, "associated mutation"], [373, 379, 407, 413, "associated mutation"], [373, 379, 407, 413, "relation undefined"], [461, 467, 509, 512, "therapeutic target"], [2475, 2484, 2520, 2526, "increased expression"]], []], "triplets": [[[260, 266, 234, 251, 344, 351], [260, 266, 253, 256, 344, 351], [283, 315, 234, 251, 344, 351], [283, 315, 253, 256, 344, 351], [373, 379, 407, 413, 365, 372], [373, 379, 407, 413, 389, 403], [461, 467, 509, 512, 487, 505], [2475, 2484, 2520, 2526, 2490, 2503]], []], "triplets_text": [[["PIK3CA", "colorectal cancer", "mutated"], ["PIK3CA", "CRC", "mutated"], ["PI3K catalytic alpha polypeptide", "colorectal cancer", "mutated"], ["PI3K catalytic alpha polypeptide", "CRC", "mutated"], ["PIK3CA", "cancer", "mutated"], ["PIK3CA", "cancer", "important role"], ["PIK3CA", "CRC", "therapeutic target"], ["tankyrase", "cancer", "overexpressed"]], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1], "sentences": ["\nConstitutive activation of PI3K signaling is one of the most frequent gene mutations in human cancer [ 1 , 2 ] and results in the activation of the downstream signaling molecule Akt, which signals cell proliferation and survival.

{"doc_key": "4636297_Discussion", "text": ["\nIn the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that the anti-cancer effects of SMA  in vitro  and  in vivo  are mediated through increased activity of the beta-catenin destruction complex. The increased activity of the beta-catenin destruction complex induced by SMA was supported by an increase in axin levels as well as suppression of tankyrase activity and increased GSK3beta activity resulting from suppression of PI3K/Akt activity. The increased axin levels and GSK3beta activity led to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of beta-catenin in SMA-treated cancer cells (HT29) as well as tumor tissues (A549 xenograft tumor tissues). Together with the results of the previous studies [ 25 , 26 ], our findings suggest that SMA is a possible candidate as a multi-target anti-cancer agent that could be applied in combination therapy with other anti-cancer agents for synergistic effects.\nBecause of the important roles played by the oncogenic mutation of  PIK3CA  in cancer cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, and motility [ 29 ], PI3K is considered a molecular target for anti-cancer drug discovery [ 30 ]. Similarly, dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway resulting in abnormal accumulation of beta-catenin is associated with the pathogeneses and poor prognosis of both colon cancer and NSCLC [ 31 ]. Moreover, anti-cancer drug resistance in NSCLC is related to abnormal beta-catenin [ 32 ]. Therefore, abnormal beta-catenin signaling is also considered a target for cancer chemotherapy [ 33 ]. However, unlike PI3K/Akt inhibition by chemical compounds, direct inhibition of beta-catenin signaling is difficult because beta-catenin is regulated via many protein-protein interactions through the beta-catenin destruction complex. The core components of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which include APC, axin, CK1, and GSK3beta, interact at extended protein-protein interfaces and are not considered viable molecular targets for drug development purposes. However, non-core tankyrase, an enzyme that causes degradation of axin which regulates GSK3beta activity, has been viewed as a molecular target for anti-cancer drug development [ 17 ]. Suppression of HT29 colon cancer cells that harbor mutations in both the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways [ 34 - 36 ], requires dual-inhibitors for both pathways. Our present study showed that SMA fulfils anti-cancer agent criteria for inhibiting genetically heterogeneous cancers by inhibiting both PI3K/Akt and tankyrase, which is a regulatory component of GSK3beta activity. Despite its low potency compared to XAV939, SMA showed a similar inhibitory effect on beta-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity. The results appear to be due to the dual inhibitory effects of SMA on PI3K/Akt and tankyrase, which results in a high level of GSK3beta activation and nuclear localization of beta-catenin. Furthermore, the present study also showed that A549 cells, which harbor mutant APC and wild-type beta-catenin similar to HT29 cells, were more sensitive to SMA than HT29 cells. A549 cells express high levels of nuclear beta-catenin, and this expression of nuclear beta-catenin is reported to be strongly associated with a poor prognosis [ 37 ]. The differential effects of SMA on HT29 and A549 cells further support that SMA exerts a strong inhibitory action in nuclear beta-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity. However, there still is a possibility that SMA may directly inhibit nuclear translocation of beta-catenin or binding of beta-catenin to the TCF/LEF1 complex.\nOur  in vivo  animal studies on CT26 syngenic and HT29 xenograft mouse models showed that the anti-tumor effect of SMA was dose-dependent and close to effect generated by 5-FU, which is the most commonly used cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs. However, 5-FU at 50 mg/kg daily causes significant side effects, such as hair loss and body weight reduction, whereas SMA did not cause such changes. Furthermore, we found combination treatment with 5-FU and SMA resulted in more potent anti-tumor activity than either drug alone without changing body weights, which suggests SMA could be used as an adjuvant therapeutic agent for CRC in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens. Cisplatin, which is most often used to treat NSCLC, has a number of associated side effects that limit its use. In particular, cisplatin nephrotoxicity, which is a major concern, is dose-related, and dose reductions are instituted when renal function is reduced. Our results show that SMA in combination with cisplatin synergistically increased anti-tumor activity in mice xenografted with A549 NSCLC without significant alteration in body weight ( S1 Fig ), which suggests SMA may be a valuable adjuvant therapeutic agent in combination with lower cisplatin doses. Additionally, similar to a previous report that silencing of beta-catenin expression with siRNA inhibited drug resistance in A549 NSCLC [ 32 ], our present study showed a strong inhibitory action in nuclear beta-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity by SMA, also suggesting that SMA may be applied for cisplatin-resistant lung cancer. Our results also provide a basis for treating cancer stem cells that possess unlimited proliferative and self-renewal abilities and are resistant to chemotherapy [ 38 , 39 ]. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is critically involved in the maintenance of cancer stem cells in a variety of cancers including colon [ 40 ] and lung [ 32 ] cancers. Our current results showing SMA exerted a dose-dependent and strong inhibitory activity against beta-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity suggest SMA as an inhibitor against cancer stem cells.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest SMA could function as a potential monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-FU or cisplatin. The molecular basis for the anti-tumor activity of SMA involves increased activity of the beta-catenin destruction complex through the inhibition of tankyrase and PI3K/Akt pathway.\n"], "ner": [[[71, 77, "DISEASE"], [309, 313, "GENE"], [347, 356, "GENE"], [380, 388, "GENE"], [428, 432, "GENE"], [433, 436, "GENE"], [461, 465, "GENE"], [477, 485, "GENE"], [552, 564, "GENE"], [580, 586, "DISEASE"], [797, 803, "DISEASE"], [871, 877, "DISEASE"]], [[925, 940, "RELATION"], [955, 973, "RELATION"], [978, 984, "GENE"], [989, 995, "DISEASE"], [1059, 1063, "GENE"], [1231, 1243, "GENE"], [1267, 1279, "RELATION"], [1284, 1298, "RELATION"], [1307, 1319, "DISEASE"], [1324, 1329, "DISEASE"], [1348, 1375, "RELATION"], [1353, 1359, "DISEASE"], [1379, 1384, "DISEASE"], [1408, 1420, "GENE"], [1449, 1461, "GENE"], [1493, 1523, "RELATION"], [1504, 1510, "DISEASE"], [1548, 1552, "GENE"], [1553, 1556, "GENE"], [1612, 1624, "GENE"], [1656, 1668, "GENE"], [1841, 1844, "GENE"], [1846, 1850, "GENE"], [1852, 1855, "GENE"], [1861, 1869, "GENE"], [2016, 2025, "GENE"], [2064, 2068, "GENE"], [2085, 2093, "GENE"], [2125, 2174, "RELATION"], [2151, 2157, "DISEASE"], [2203, 2215, "DISEASE"], [2399, 2405, "DISEASE"], [2462, 2468, "DISEASE"], [2489, 2493, "GENE"], [2494, 2497, "GENE"], [2502, 2511, "GENE"], [2548, 2556, "GENE"], [2653, 2665, "GENE"], [2680, 2684, "GENE"], [2781, 2785, "GENE"], [2786, 2789, "GENE"], [2794, 2803, "GENE"], [2838, 2846, "GENE"], [2886, 2898, "GENE"], [2980, 2983, "GENE"], [2998, 3010, "GENE"], [3120, 3132, "GENE"], [3165, 3177, "GENE"], [3371, 3383, "GENE"], [3398, 3402, "GENE"], [3522, 3534, "GENE"], [3549, 3561, "GENE"]], [[3811, 3817, "DISEASE"], [4205, 4208, "DISEASE"], [4306, 4311, "DISEASE"], [4656, 4661, "DISEASE"], [4888, 4900, "GENE"], [4957, 4962, "DISEASE"], [5034, 5046, "GENE"], [5061, 5065, "GENE"], [5163, 5174, "DISEASE"], [5222, 5228, "DISEASE"], [5423, 5429, "DISEASE"], [5457, 5463, "DISEASE"], [[5475, 5504], [5480, 5510], "DISEASE"], [[5492, 5504], [5496, 5510], "DISEASE"], [5609, 5621, "GENE"], [5636, 5640, "GENE"], [5702, 5708, "DISEASE"]], [[5977, 5989, "GENE"], [6036, 6045, "GENE"]]], "relations": [[], [[978, 984, 989, 995, "relation undefined"], [978, 984, 989, 995, "causative mutation"], [1231, 1243, 1307, 1319, "pathological role"], [1231, 1243, 1307, 1319, "negative prognostic marker"], [1231, 1243, 1324, 1329, "pathological role"], [1231, 1243, 1324, 1329, "negative prognostic marker"], [1408, 1420, 1379, 1384, "therapy resistance"], [1449, 1461, 1504, 1510, "therapeutic target"], [2016, 2025, 2151, 2157, "therapeutic target"]], [], []], "triplets": [[], [[978, 984, 989, 995, 925, 940], [978, 984, 989, 995, 955, 973], [1231, 1243, 1307, 1319, 1267, 1279], [1231, 1243, 1324, 1329, 1267, 1279], [1231, 1243, 1307, 1319, 1284, 1298], [1231, 1243, 1324, 1329, 1284, 1298], [1408, 1420, 1379, 1384, 1348, 1375], [1449, 1461, 1504, 1510, 1493, 1523], [2016, 2025, 2151, 2157, 2125, 2174]], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [["PIK3CA", "cancer", "important roles"], ["PIK3CA", "cancer", "oncogenic mutation"], ["beta - catenin", "colon cancer", "pathogeneses"], ["beta - catenin", "NSCLC", "pathogeneses"], ["beta - catenin", "colon cancer", "poor prognosis"], ["beta - catenin", "NSCLC", "poor prognosis"], ["beta - catenin", "NSCLC", "anti - cancer drug resistance"], ["beta - catenin", "cancer", "target for cancer chemotherapy"], ["tankyrase", "cancer", "molecular target for anti - cancer drug development"]], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3], "sentences": ["\nIn the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that the anti-cancer effects of SMA  in vitro  and  in vivo  are mediated through increased activity of the beta-catenin destruction complex. The increased activity of the beta-catenin destruction complex induced by SMA was supported by an increase in axin levels as well as suppression of tankyrase activity and increased GSK3beta activity resulting from suppression of PI3K/Akt activity. The increased axin levels and GSK3beta activity led to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of beta-catenin in SMA-treated cancer cells (HT29) as well as tumor tissues (A549 xenograft tumor tissues). Together with the results of the previous studies [ 25 , 26 ], our findings suggest that SMA is a possible candidate as a multi-target anti-cancer agent that could be applied in combination therapy with other anti-cancer agents for synergistic effects.\n", "Because of the important roles played by the oncogenic mutation of  PIK3CA  in cancer cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, and motility [ 29 ], PI3K is considered a molecular target for anti-cancer drug discovery [ 30 ]. Similarly, dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway resulting in abnormal accumulation of beta-catenin is associated with the pathogeneses and poor prognosis of both colon cancer and NSCLC [ 31 ]. Moreover, anti-cancer drug resistance in NSCLC is related to abnormal beta-catenin [ 32 ]. Therefore, abnormal beta-catenin signaling is also considered a target for cancer chemotherapy [ 33 ]. However, unlike PI3K/Akt inhibition by chemical compounds, direct inhibition of beta-catenin signaling is difficult because beta-catenin is regulated via many protein-protein interactions through the beta-catenin destruction complex. The core components of the beta-catenin destruction complex, which include APC, axin, CK1, and GSK3beta, interact at extended protein-protein interfaces and are not considered viable molecular targets for drug development purposes. However, non-core tankyrase, an enzyme that causes degradation of axin which regulates GSK3beta activity, has been viewed as a molecular target for anti-cancer drug development [ 17 ]. Suppression of HT29 colon cancer cells that harbor mutations in both the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways [ 34 - 36 ], requires dual-inhibitors for both pathways. Our present study showed that SMA fulfils anti-cancer agent criteria for inhibiting genetically heterogeneous cancers by inhibiting both PI3K/Akt and tankyrase, which is a regulatory component of GSK3beta activity. Despite its low potency compared to XAV939, SMA showed a similar inhibitory effect on beta-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity. The results appear to be due to the dual inhibitory effects of SMA on PI3K/Akt and tankyrase, which results in a high level of GSK3beta activation and nuclear localization of beta-catenin. Furthermore, the present study also showed that A549 cells, which harbor mutant APC and wild-type beta-catenin similar to HT29 cells, were more sensitive to SMA than HT29 cells. A549 cells express high levels of nuclear beta-catenin, and this expression of nuclear beta-catenin is reported to be strongly associated with a poor prognosis [ 37 ]. The differential effects of SMA on HT29 and A549 cells further support that SMA exerts a strong inhibitory action in nuclear beta-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity. However, there still is a possibility that SMA may directly inhibit nuclear translocation of beta-catenin or binding of beta-catenin to the TCF/LEF1 complex.\n", "Our  in vivo  animal studies on CT26 syngenic and HT29 xenograft mouse models showed that the anti-tumor effect of SMA was dose-dependent and close to effect generated by 5-FU, which is the most commonly used cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs. However, 5-FU at 50 mg/kg daily causes significant side effects, such as hair loss and body weight reduction, whereas SMA did not cause such changes. Furthermore, we found combination treatment with 5-FU and SMA resulted in more potent anti-tumor activity than either drug alone without changing body weights, which suggests SMA could be used as an adjuvant therapeutic agent for CRC in combination with standard chemotherapy regimens.

In the present study, we report that 7- O -succinyl macrolactin A (SMA) suppresses tumor growth by stabilizing the beta-catenin destruction complex, which was achieved through inhibition of regulatory components associated with the complex. SMA significantly reduced the activities of PI3K/Akt, which corresponded with a decrease in GSK3beta phosphorylation, an increase in beta-catenin phosphorylation, and a reduction in nuclear beta-catenin content in HT29 human colon cancer cells.

{"doc_key": "4550874_Results", "text": ["\nCx43 is lateralized in DMD mice, correlating with overall disease severity\nThe aberrant localization and protein expression of Cx43 have been largely associated with various heart disease models. While presence at the intercalated discs is required for proper cardiac conduction, lateralization and altered levels contribute significantly to cardiac pathology. To assess potential changes in expression and localization of Cx43 in the hearts of multiple models of DMD, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) staining on sections from WT, mdx, and mdx:utr mice at 2, 4, 8, and 12 months of age. mdx:utr mice were analyzed until the 4 month time point, as these animals typically only survive up to 3-4 months due to the severity of the disease 34 . In WT mice, Cx43 localizes tightly to the intercalated discs (93% \u00b1 2% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5), critical for the formation of gap junctions and proper electrical signal conduction between cardiomyocytes ( Fig. 1a,b ). However, in mdx mouse hearts, even at 2, 4, and 8 months of age where no histopathology is present, Cx43 localization was significantly lateralized, with only 67% \u00b1 3.5% (MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 7) expression at the intercalated discs ( Fig. 1a,b ). In addition, through analysis of the more severe mdx:utr double knock out model of DMD, an even lower proportion of Cx43 expression was observed at intercalated discs (46% \u00b1 5% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5), demonstrating that while initial Cx43 remodeling occurs before overt cardiac pathology is present, it increases as signs of dilated cardiomyopathy and fibrosis appear ( Fig. 1a,b ). The mdx:utr model of DMD is known to develop significant cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and degeneration, with related decreased overall cardiac function towards end stages of disease, similar to symptoms exhibited by patients 34 35 .\nAs Cx43 is known to have a very short half-life and undergo rapid turnover in response to cardiac stimuli 36 37 , we sought to examine the effect of beta-adrenergic challenge on protein expression patterns. WT, mdx, and mdx:utr mice were challenged by Iso (5 mg/kg IP) and hearts were visualized for related changes in Cx43 within one hour ( Fig. 1c ). We found a significant increase in the lateralization of Cx43 in both mdx (51% \u00b1 4% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5, at IDs) and mdx:utr (35.75% \u00b1 3.75% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5, at IDs) mouse hearts, to levels greater than those seen prior to challenge, while WT hearts remained relatively unaffected (88% \u00b1 2.5% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 6) ( Fig. 1c,d ).\nBy performing western blot analysis on protein samples from each animal, we found that overall Cx43 levels were increased in DMD mice compared to WT ( Fig. 1e,f ). Specifically, mdx mice displayed a 1.92 \u00b1 0.32 fold increase in Cx43 protein levels while the more severe mdx:utr mice exhibited even greater Cx43 upregulation (2.71 \u00b1 0.49 fold), compared to WT mice ( Fig. 1f ). We further sought to examine whether the Pannexin-1 protein was dysregulated in DMD mice, as it has been shown to form hemichannels with properties similar to those formed by Cx43 38 . By western blot analysis of Panexin1, we found no significant differences in protein levels in mdx mice, compared to WT ( Supplementary Fig. 1a,b ). This indicated that Cx43 could specifically be playing a significant role in DMD pathological hearts in regards to channel function. Taken together, our findings show that Cx43 is not only redistributed to lateral sides of the cardiomyocytes but also upregulated at those positions.\nHuman DMD hearts display lateralized and upregulated Cx43\nTo examine whether altered Cx43 protein expression and lateralization are also present in human DMD, we performed Cx43 analysis on heart samples obtained from multiple non-DMD and DMD patients. Immunofluorescence indicates that DMD patients' hearts exhibit significantly lateralized expression patterns of Cx43, compared to non-DMD individuals, at percentages similar to the severe DMD mouse model (49% \u00b1 9% localized to IDs) ( Fig. 2a,b ).\nWestern blot analysis was performed on tissue samples from each patient analyzed by IF to quantify differences in protein expression levels. Results show that overall Cx43 is significantly upregulated in DMD patients compared to non-DMD (4.92 \u00b1 0.92 fold), again at levels similar to, or even greater than, those seen in severe DMD mice ( Fig. 2c,d ). These findings indicate that Cx43 may play an important role in human DMD cardiomyopathy and that mouse models properly mimic levels and expression patterns seen in patients, even in DMD heart failure.\nmdx and mdx:utr models of DMD develop severe arrhythmias\nAs proper protein levels and localization of Cx43 are known to be required for cardiac function, our initial findings led us to examine  in vivo  parameters that could be influenced by aberrant protein expression and localization of Cx43. WT, mdx, an mdx:utr mice underwent electrocardiography (ECG) to visualize disturbances in electrical conduction as a possible result of altered Cx43 activity. At baseline, no group showed significant spontaneous arrhythmias ( Fig. 3a ) and RR intervals did not show significant variation (WT: 127 ms; mdx: 126 ms; mdx:utr: 124 ms). Iso was used to challenge mice, at conditions equal to those previously mentioned, examining the susceptibility of these hearts to the development of conduction related disorders. Following administration, both mdx and mdx:utr mice developed arrhythmias within minutes, while WT mice did not show any signs of arrhythmias throughout the duration of analysis ( Fig. 3b,d ). Along with the initial occurrence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in mdx and mdx:utr mice, R-R intervals were significantly decreased below 95 ms in each mouse (mdx: RR = 93 ms; mdx:utr: RR = 90 ms)( Fig. 3b ) followed by undetermined values after arrhythmia scores worsened due to absent QRS complexes ( Fig. 3f ), translating to an increase in heart rate of about 165 beats per minute (bpm). WT mice also experienced shortened R-R intervals but to a lesser extent (WT: RR = 103 ms,  Fig. 3f ), increasing heart rate by about 100 bpm. While several mdx mice progressed to develop non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or AV blocks during the challenge (Arrhythmia Score = 2 or 4, accordingly), mdx:utr mice quickly advanced to sustained VT and AV block, and a majority died within 1 hour of initial Iso administration (Arrhythmia Score = 3, 4, or 5, accordingly) ( Fig. 3d ). ECG tracings also show a slight increase in QT intervals in mdx mice compared to WT both at baseline (WT = 47.3 ms, mdx = 49.7 ms) and after Iso (WT = 39.7 ms, mdx = 44.7 ms) ( Fig. 3g ). QT intervals could not be assessed properly in mdx:utr mice due to the rapid onset of VT and the related absence of distinct Q and T waves. As WT mice are known to be mainly unaffected by many fold higher doses of Iso 32 , these findings show a potential link between overall cardiac dysfunction in DMD and Cx43.\nCx43 Inhibition Prevents Arrhythmias in DMD Models\nAs a possible mechanism to address the occurrence of arrhythmias in DMD mouse models, Cx43 hemichannels were directly targeted for functional inhibition using two different mimetic peptides, Gap26 and Gap19, designed to prevent the binding of sequences necessary for channel opening 27 . As Gap26 has been shown to be able to also inhibit gap junctions in a dose and time dependent manner, our studies utilized low, single doses. In addition, Gap19 was used as a more hemichannel selective peptide mimetic due to the role of the target sequence in hemichannel but not gap junction channel opening.\nBy treating mice with Gap 26 or Gap 19 prior to Iso administration, both DMD models showed significant decreases in conduction deficiencies ( Fig. 3c ). A majority of mdx mice (90%) were effectively protected from the development of VT and PVCs following even a low dose of Gap 26 (1 ug/kg) or Gap 19 (10 ug/kg) treatment (Arrhythmia Score = 0) ( Fig. 3e ). Optimal dosage was determined as lowest dose providing significant change in arrhythmia score. As Gap 26 corresponds to an extracellular sequence and Gap 19 corresponds to an intracellular sequence, a higher dose was required of Gap 19 to provide similar benefit as expected. Since the results of both treatments separately lead to equivalent scores and ECG patterns, measurements for Gap 26 and Gap 19 treated mice are expressed together. ECG intervals measured in treated, challenged DMD mice were significantly rescued to WT levels (WT: QT = 46 ms; mdx: QT = 47.7 ms; mdx:utr: QT = 44 ms) ( Fig. 3g ), with some intervals being further rescued even closer to baseline (mdx: RR = 115 ms compared to baseline mdx:126 ms) ( Fig. 3f ). To assess whether targeting Pannexin-1 could similarly protect DMD mice from challenge related symptoms, a Pannexin-1 inhibiting peptide mimetic was utilized. In both treated mdx and mdx:utr mice, arrhythmogenesis occurred following challenge to the same extent as untreated challenged mice (mdx: Arrhythmia Score = 3; mdx:utr: Arrhythmia Score = 5) ( Supplementary Fig. 1c,d ). In addition, western blot analysis was performed on baseline, Iso challenged, and Cx43 peptide mimetic treated Iso challenged cardiac samples to view a potential role of the sodium channel Na v 1.5 in the rescue of lethality and arrhythmogenesis. Previous findings have shown the downregulation of Na v 1.5 in mdx(5 cv) mice, and that transgenic upregulation provides a therapeutically beneficial restoration of sodium current that may prevent the development of arrhythmias 39 40 . Our results confirm that DMD mice display decreased protein levels of Na v 1.5, but show that no significant changes occur following Cx43 peptide mimetic treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b ). Together, these findings indicate a significant, specific role for Cx43 hemichannel inhibition in preventing the onset of arrhythmias in DMD and in protecting DMD hearts from overall challenge-related effects.\nmdx mice treated with Gap 26 or Gap 19 survive following Iso challenge\nFollowing Iso challenge and the development of arrhythmias, we found that DMD mice displayed significant mortality within a short period of time 32 33 . A majority of mdx mice died within 24 hours after Iso was administered, while many mdx:utr mice died within only 1 hour following challenge ( Fig. 4 ). However, 90% of mdx mice treated with either the Gap 26 or Gap 19 Cx43 peptide mimetic prior to Iso challenge were protected from both arrhythmogenesis and related lethality ( Fig. 4 ). Although mdx:utr mice received substantial benefits from treatment in terms of ECG readouts, overall lethality was not prevented. These mice showed only slightly increased durations of survival ( Fig. 4 ). Since mdx:utr mice do display overt cardiac and skeletal muscle histopathology as early as 2 months of age, models at this advanced stage of disease may not receive as significant a benefit as those in earlier stages such as mdx mice. To verify the selective benefits of Cx43 mediation, Pannexin-1 peptide mimetic treated DMD mice were challenged and monitored for survival. These mice died within durations comparable to untreated, isoproterenol challenged DMD mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ), consistent with observed arrhythmogenesis ( Supplementary Fig. 1c,d ) and an overall lack of Pannexin-1 peptide mimetic protective effects. Overall, our results show that mdx mice are successfully protected from arrhythmogenesis and death by Cx43 selective inhibition, and that while mdx:utr mice receive considerable cardiac benefits, treatment may be more effective if started at earlier ages before critical disease time points.\nThese results strongly implicate Cx43 in overall cardiac pathology and disease progression in DMD, and may have a significant impact on therapeutic development to combat a leading cause of death in the disease.\n"], "ner": [[[1, 5, "GENE"], [24, 27, "DISEASE"], [128, 132, "GENE"], [175, 188, "DISEASE"], [424, 428, "GENE"], [465, 468, "DISEASE"], [759, 763, "GENE"], [1060, 1064, "GENE"], [1285, 1288, "DISEASE"], [[1298, 1323], [1317, 1333], "RELATION"], [1318, 1322, "GENE"], [1432, 1436, "GENE"], [1602, 1605, "DISEASE"]], [[1820, 1824, "GENE"], [2227, 2231, "GENE"]], [[2592, 2596, "GENE"], [2597, 2618, "RELATION"], [2622, 2625, "DISEASE"], [2725, 2729, "GENE"], [2803, 2807, "GENE"], [2915, 2925, "GENE"], [2954, 2957, "DISEASE"], [3049, 3053, "GENE"], [3228, 3232, "GENE"], [3255, 3281, "RELATION"], [3285, 3288, "DISEASE"], [3380, 3384, "GENE"]], [[3497, 3500, "DISEASE"], [3544, 3548, "GENE"], [3576, 3580, "GENE"], [3645, 3648, "DISEASE"], [3663, 3667, "GENE"], [3721, 3724, "DISEASE"], [3729, 3732, "DISEASE"], [3777, 3780, "DISEASE"], [3855, 3859, "GENE"], [3877, 3880, "DISEASE"], [3931, 3934, "DISEASE"]], [[4157, 4161, "GENE"], [4165, 4190, "RELATION"], [4194, 4197, "DISEASE"], [4223, 4226, "DISEASE"], [4318, 4321, "DISEASE"], [4371, 4375, "GENE"], [4380, 4402, "RELATION"], [4412, 4415, "DISEASE"], [4416, 4430, "DISEASE"], [4525, 4528, "DISEASE"], [4529, 4542, "DISEASE"]], [[4646, 4650, "GENE"], [4834, 4838, "GENE"], [4984, 4988, "GENE"], [6927, 6930, "DISEASE"], [6935, 6939, "GENE"]], [[6941, 6945, "GENE"], [6981, 6984, "DISEASE"], [7060, 7063, "DISEASE"], [7078, 7082, "GENE"]], [[7663, 7666, "DISEASE"], [8434, 8437, "DISEASE"], [8711, 8721, "GENE"], [8746, 8749, "DISEASE"], [8790, 8800, "GENE"], [9144, 9148, "GENE"], [9570, 9573, "DISEASE"], [9678, 9682, "GENE"], [9805, 9809, "GENE"], [9875, 9878, "DISEASE"], [9897, 9900, "DISEASE"]], [[10093, 10096, "DISEASE"], [10390, 10394, "GENE"], [10987, 10991, "GENE"], [11038, 11041, "DISEASE"], [11174, 11177, "DISEASE"], [11303, 11313, "GENE"], [11452, 11456, "GENE"]], [[11675, 11679, "GENE"], [11736, 11739, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[1318, 1322, 1285, 1288, "decreased expression"]], [], [[2592, 2596, 2622, 2625, "increased expression"], [3228, 3232, 3285, 3288, "relation undefined"]], [], [[4157, 4161, 4194, 4197, "increased expression"], [4371, 4375, 4412, 4415, "relation undefined"], [4371, 4375, 4416, 4430, "relation undefined"]], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[[1318, 1322, 1285, 1288, [1298, 1323], [1317, 1333]]], [], [[2592, 2596, 2622, 2625, 2597, 2618], [3228, 3232, 3285, 3288, 3255, 3281]], [], [[4157, 4161, 4194, 4197, 4165, 4190], [4371, 4375, 4412, 4415, 4380, 4402], [4371, 4375, 4416, 4430, 4380, 4402]], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[["Cx43", "DMD", "lower proportion of expression"]], [], [["Cx43", "DMD", "levels were increased"], ["Cx43", "DMD", "playing a significant role"]], [], [["Cx43", "DMD", "significantly upregulated"], ["Cx43", "DMD", "play an important role"], ["Cx43", "cardiomyopathy", "play an important role"]], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], "sentences": ["\nCx43 is lateralized in DMD mice, correlating with overall disease severity\nThe aberrant localization and protein expression of Cx43 have been largely associated with various heart disease models. While presence at the intercalated discs is required for proper cardiac conduction, lateralization and altered levels contribute significantly to cardiac pathology. To assess potential changes in expression and localization of Cx43 in the hearts of multiple models of DMD, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) staining on sections from WT, mdx, and mdx:utr mice at 2, 4, 8, and 12 months of age. mdx:utr mice were analyzed until the 4 month time point, as these animals typically only survive up to 3-4 months due to the severity of the disease 34 . In WT mice, Cx43 localizes tightly to the intercalated discs (93% \u00b1 2% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5), critical for the formation of gap junctions and proper electrical signal conduction between cardiomyocytes ( Fig. 1a,b ). However, in mdx mouse hearts, even at 2, 4, and 8 months of age where no histopathology is present, Cx43 localization was significantly lateralized, with only 67% \u00b1 3.5% (MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 7) expression at the intercalated discs ( Fig. 1a,b ). In addition, through analysis of the more severe mdx:utr double knock out model of DMD, an even lower proportion of Cx43 expression was observed at intercalated discs (46% \u00b1 5% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5), demonstrating that while initial Cx43 remodeling occurs before overt cardiac pathology is present, it increases as signs of dilated cardiomyopathy and fibrosis appear ( Fig. 1a,b ). The mdx:utr model of DMD is known to develop significant cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and degeneration, with related decreased overall cardiac function towards end stages of disease, similar to symptoms exhibited by patients 34 35 .\n", "As Cx43 is known to have a very short half-life and undergo rapid turnover in response to cardiac stimuli 36 37 , we sought to examine the effect of beta-adrenergic challenge on protein expression patterns. WT, mdx, and mdx:utr mice were challenged by Iso (5 mg/kg IP) and hearts were visualized for related changes in Cx43 within one hour ( Fig. 1c ). We found a significant increase in the lateralization of Cx43 in both mdx (51% \u00b1 4% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5, at IDs) and mdx:utr (35.75% \u00b1 3.75% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 5, at IDs) mouse hearts, to levels greater than those seen prior to challenge, while WT hearts remained relatively unaffected (88% \u00b1 2.5% MEAN \u00b1 SEM, n = 6) ( Fig. 1c,d ).\n", "By performing western blot analysis on protein samples from each animal, we found that overall Cx43 levels were increased in DMD mice compared to WT ( Fig. 1e,f ). Specifically, mdx mice displayed a 1.92 \u00b1 0.32 fold increase in Cx43 protein levels while the more severe mdx:utr mice exhibited even greater Cx43 upregulation (2.71 \u00b1 0.49 fold), compared to WT mice ( Fig. 1f ). We further sought to examine whether the Pannexin-1 protein was dysregulated in DMD mice, as it has been shown to form hemichannels with properties similar to those formed by Cx43 38 . By western blot analysis of Panexin1, we found no significant differences in protein levels in mdx mice, compared to WT ( Supplementary Fig. 1a,b ). This indicated that Cx43 could specifically be playing a significant role in DMD pathological hearts in regards to channel function. Taken together, our findings show that Cx43 is not only redistributed to lateral sides of the cardiomyocytes but also upregulated at those positions.\n", "Human DMD hearts display lateralized and upregulated Cx43\nTo examine whether altered Cx43 protein expression and lateralization are also present in human DMD, we performed Cx43 analysis on heart samples obtained from multiple non-DMD and DMD patients. Immunofluorescence indicates that DMD patients' hearts exhibit significantly lateralized expression patterns of Cx43, compared to non-DMD individuals, at percentages similar to the severe DMD mouse model (49% \u00b1 9% localized to IDs) ( Fig. 2a,b ).\n", "Western blot analysis was performed on tissue samples from each patient analyzed by IF to quantify differences in protein expression levels. Results show that overall Cx43 is significantly upregulated in DMD patients compared to non-DMD (4.92 \u00b1 0.92 fold), again at levels similar to, or even greater than, those seen in severe DMD mice ( Fig. 2c,d ). These findings indicate that Cx43 may play an important role in human DMD cardiomyopathy and that mouse models properly mimic levels and expression patterns seen in patients, even in DMD heart failure.\n", "mdx and mdx:utr models of DMD develop severe arrhythmias\nAs proper protein levels and localization of Cx43 are known to be required for cardiac function, our initial findings led us to examine  in vivo  parameters that could be influenced by aberrant protein expression and localization of Cx43. WT, mdx, an mdx:utr mice underwent electrocardiography (ECG) to visualize disturbances in electrical conduction as a possible result of altered Cx43 activity. At baseline, no group showed significant spontaneous arrhythmias ( Fig. 3a ) and RR intervals did not show significant variation (WT: 127 ms; mdx: 126 ms; mdx:utr: 124 ms). Iso was used to challenge mice, at conditions equal to those previously mentioned, examining the susceptibility of these hearts to the development of conduction related disorders. Following administration, both mdx and mdx:utr mice developed arrhythmias within minutes, while WT mice did not show any signs of arrhythmias throughout the duration of analysis ( Fig. 3b,d ). Along with the initial occurrence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in mdx and mdx:utr mice, R-R intervals were significantly decreased below 95 ms in each mouse (mdx: RR = 93 ms; mdx:utr: RR = 90 ms)( Fig. 3b ) followed by undetermined values after arrhythmia scores worsened due to absent QRS complexes ( Fig. 3f ), translating to an increase in heart rate of about 165 beats per minute (bpm). WT mice also experienced shortened R-R intervals but to a lesser extent (WT: RR = 103 ms,  Fig. 3f ), increasing heart rate by about 100 bpm. While several mdx mice progressed to develop non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or AV blocks during the challenge (Arrhythmia Score = 2 or 4, accordingly), mdx:utr mice quickly advanced to sustained VT and AV block, and a majority died within 1 hour of initial Iso administration (Arrhythmia Score = 3, 4, or 5, accordingly) ( Fig. 3d ). ECG tracings also show a slight increase in QT intervals in mdx mice compared to WT both at baseline (WT = 47.3 ms, mdx = 49.7 ms) and after Iso (WT = 39.7 ms, mdx = 44.7 ms) ( Fig. 3g ). QT intervals could not be assessed properly in mdx:utr mice due to the rapid onset of VT and the related absence of distinct Q and T waves. As WT mice are known to be mainly unaffected by many fold higher doses of Iso 32 , these findings show a potential link between overall cardiac dysfunction in DMD and Cx43.\n", "Cx43 Inhibition Prevents Arrhythmias in DMD Models\nAs a possible mechanism to address the occurrence of arrhythmias in DMD mouse models, Cx43 hemichannels were directly targeted for functional inhibition using two different mimetic peptides, Gap26 and Gap19, designed to prevent the binding of sequences necessary for channel opening 27 . As Gap26 has been shown to be able to also inhibit gap junctions in a dose and time dependent manner, our studies utilized low, single doses. In addition, Gap19 was used as a more hemichannel selective peptide mimetic due to the role of the target sequence in hemichannel but not gap junction channel opening.\n", "By treating mice with Gap 26 or Gap 19 prior to Iso administration, both DMD models showed significant decreases in conduction deficiencies ( Fig. 3c ). A majority of mdx mice (90%) were effectively protected from the development of VT and PVCs following even a low dose of Gap 26 (1 ug/kg) or Gap 19 (10 ug/kg) treatment (Arrhythmia Score = 0) ( Fig. 3e ). Optimal dosage was determined as lowest dose providing significant change in arrhythmia score. As Gap 26 corresponds to an extracellular sequence and Gap 19 corresponds to an intracellular sequence, a higher dose was required of Gap 19 to provide similar benefit as expected. Since the results of both treatments separately lead to equivalent scores and ECG patterns, measurements for Gap 26 and Gap 19 treated mice are expressed together. ECG intervals measured in treated, challenged DMD mice were significantly rescued to WT levels (WT: QT = 46 ms; mdx: QT = 47.7 ms; mdx:utr: QT = 44 ms) ( Fig. 3g ), with some intervals being further rescued even closer to baseline (mdx: RR = 115 ms compared to baseline mdx:126 ms) ( Fig. 3f ). To assess whether targeting Pannexin-1 could similarly protect DMD mice from challenge related symptoms, a Pannexin-1 inhibiting peptide mimetic was utilized. In both treated mdx and mdx:utr mice, arrhythmogenesis occurred following challenge to the same extent as untreated challenged mice (mdx: Arrhythmia Score = 3; mdx:utr: Arrhythmia Score = 5) ( Supplementary Fig. 1c,d ). In addition, western blot analysis was performed on baseline, Iso challenged, and Cx43 peptide mimetic treated Iso challenged cardiac samples to view a potential role of the sodium channel Na v 1.5 in the rescue of lethality and arrhythmogenesis. Previous findings have shown the downregulation of Na v 1.5 in mdx(5 cv) mice, and that transgenic upregulation provides a therapeutically beneficial restoration of sodium current that may prevent the development of arrhythmias 39 40 . Our results confirm that DMD mice display decreased protein levels of Na v 1.5, but show that no significant changes occur following Cx43 peptide mimetic treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b ). Together, these findings indicate a significant, specific role for Cx43 hemichannel inhibition in preventing the onset of arrhythmias in DMD and in protecting DMD hearts from overall challenge-related effects.\n", "mdx mice treated with Gap 26 or Gap 19 survive following Iso challenge\nFollowing Iso challenge and the development of arrhythmias, we found that DMD mice displayed significant mortality within a short period of time 32 33 . A majority of mdx mice died within 24 hours after Iso was administered, while many mdx:utr mice died within only 1 hour following challenge ( Fig. 4 ). However, 90% of mdx mice treated with either the Gap 26 or Gap 19 Cx43 peptide mimetic prior to Iso challenge were protected from both arrhythmogenesis and related lethality ( Fig. 4 ). Although mdx:utr mice received substantial benefits from treatment in terms of ECG readouts, overall lethality was not prevented. These mice showed only slightly increased durations of survival ( Fig. 4 ). Since mdx:utr mice do display overt cardiac and skeletal muscle histopathology as early as 2 months of age, models at this advanced stage of disease may not receive as significant a benefit as those in earlier stages such as mdx mice. To verify the selective benefits of Cx43 mediation, Pannexin-1 peptide mimetic treated DMD mice were challenged and monitored for survival. These mice died within durations comparable to untreated, isoproterenol challenged DMD mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1e ), consistent with observed arrhythmogenesis ( Supplementary Fig. 1c,d ) and an overall lack of Pannexin-1 peptide mimetic protective effects. Overall, our results show that mdx mice are successfully protected from arrhythmogenesis and death by Cx43 selective inhibition, and that while mdx:utr mice receive considerable cardiac benefits, treatment may be more effective if started at earlier ages before critical disease time points.\n", "These results strongly implicate Cx43 in overall cardiac pathology and disease progression in DMD, and may have a significant impact on therapeutic development to combat a leading cause of death in the disease.\n"]}

Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and densitometric analysis was performed using Fuji Images or Bio-Rad Image Lab software.\nElectrocardiography\nWhole animal electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded using needle electrodes in a Lead II configuration. Animals were anesthetized by Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, 290 mg/kg IP) and kept at a constant 37\u00b0 temperature using a heating pad for the duration of analysis. ECG signals were acquired using a DSI Ponemah amplifier and pClamp Axoscope 10 software (Molecular Devices.) Following baseline reading, animals were treated for 20 minutes with the Connexin 43 mimetic peptide 43-Gap 26 (Anaspec, Sequence: VCYDKSFPISHVR, 1 ug/kg IV) or Gap 19 (Custom synthesized, Sequence: KQIEIKKFK, 10 ug/kg IV) via retro orbital injection. The sequence of Gap 26 corresponds to that of the first extracellular loop of Cx43 and inhibits the interaction between it and an adjacent Cx43 protein. The sequence of Gap 19 corresponds to that of the intracellular cytoplasmic loop of Cx43 and inhibits the interaction between it and the Cx43 C-terminus, which is required for hemichannel opening 21 27 28 . Negative control animals were treated for the same duration with a Pannexin-1 mimetic peptide (Anaspec, Sequence: WRQAAFVDSY, 10 ug/kg or 100 ug/kg IV) or a similar volume of saline.

Animals were anesthetized by Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, 290 mg/kg IP) and kept at a constant 37\u00b0 temperature using a heating pad for the duration of analysis. ECG signals were acquired using a DSI Ponemah amplifier and pClamp Axoscope 10 software (Molecular Devices.) Following baseline reading, animals were treated for 20 minutes with the Connexin 43 mimetic peptide 43-Gap 26 (Anaspec, Sequence: VCYDKSFPISHVR, 1 ug/kg IV) or Gap 19 (Custom synthesized, Sequence: KQIEIKKFK, 10 ug/kg IV) via retro orbital injection. The sequence of Gap 26 corresponds to that of the first extracellular loop of Cx43 and inhibits the interaction between it and an adjacent Cx43 protein. The sequence of Gap 19 corresponds to that of the intracellular cytoplasmic loop of Cx43 and inhibits the interaction between it and the Cx43 C-terminus, which is required for hemichannel opening 21 27 28 . Negative control animals were treated for the same duration with a Pannexin-1 mimetic peptide (Anaspec, Sequence: WRQAAFVDSY, 10 ug/kg or 100 ug/kg IV) or a similar volume of saline. Following treatment time, mice were challenged by isoproterenol (Iso, Sigma, 5 mg/kg IP) and ECGs were constantly recorded. Arrhythmias were scored based on a point system where: 0 = no arrhythmias, 1 = single premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), 2 = double PVCs, 3 = non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), 4 = sustained VT or atrioventricular (AV) block, and 5 = death. ECG parameters including RR, QRS, and QT intervals were measured at a significant number of randomly selected points to obtain representative values.\n", "Statistics\nData was evaluated for statistical significance using parametric analysis in GraphPad Prism or SigmaPlot software (ANOVA in the case of three groups or paired T-tests in the case of two groups) and expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.

{"doc_key": "4550874_Discussion", "text": ["\nThe identification of secondary factors for the treatment of DMD has become increasingly essential, as decades of research on dystrophin have demonstrated the difficulty in direct therapeutic targeting. In addition, the lack of sufficient knowledge related to the structural and functional roles of dystrophin in the heart have impeded cardiac research. More recently, as steroid therapy and ventilator use to combat respiratory failure became common practice, statistics have shown that heart failure has continued to grow as a prominent cause of death, with 100% of DMD patients over the age of 21 developing dilated cardiomyopathy 9 10 11 . With dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by arrhythmogenesis and protein remodeling, we sought to uncover downstream mechanisms in DMD that could be responsible for this pathology. Our studies focused on targeting Cx43, a gap junction protein and the most abundant cardiac connexin, required for maintaining proper ion trafficking and electrical signal propagation between cardiomyocytes. We discovered that through selective inhibition of Cx43 function, by administering peptide mimetics in a preemptive manner, we were able to prevent the occurrence of arrhythmias and lethality in Iso challenged mdx mice.\nAlthough human DMD patients are known to develop dilated cardiomyopathy by late teens to early twenties, a majority of patients also develop arrhythmias at much younger ages. While these patients age and fibrosis occurs due to myocyte degeneration, the prevalence and intensity of arrhythmias increase accordingly. Our animal data shows that as early as 2 months of age, a low dose of Iso, administered as a minor cardiac stressor that is harmless to WT mice, is able to cause arrhythmogenesis in mild mdx mice. These arrhythmias are mainly constrained to PVCs, but as the animals age they become more intense. In addition, also at 2 months of age, the severe mdx:utr mouse shows that the same low dose of Iso causes significant ventricular arrhythmias leading to periods of tachycardia, bradycardia, and an eventual AV block indicative of heart failure. In both of these models, in addition to causing arrhythmias, the low dose of Iso is lethal, with mdx mice dying within an average of 24-48 hours and mdx:utr mice dying within an hour of monitoring.\nConnexin remodeling has long been associated with cardiac disease, especially related to ischemia, hypertrophy, and heart failure. While typically Cx43 localizes to the intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes, forming gap junctions for the propagation of cardiac action potentials, a redistribution of the protein to the myocyte sarcolemma occurs in heart disease. In these positions, Cx43 proteins are believed to form nonjunctional hemichannels rather than functional gap junctions. These hemichannels may cause the influx of sodium and calcium ions, affecting membrane potential and impacting cardiac electrical conduction. This has the direct potential of leading to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, the exacerbated opening of Cx43 hemichannels can lead to the loss of the electrochemical gradient and intercellular metabolites, such as glutathione and ATP, making cardiomyocytes more susceptible to damage and volume overload 41 . Our data show that in both animal models and human DMD patients, Cx43 expression is dramatically altered, with a stark redistribution of the protein to the lateral sides of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, while the mild mdx mouse shows a significant lateralization, the effect is even more pronounced in both the severe mdx:utr mouse and in human DMD patient hearts analyzed. Our results also show that protein levels are dramatically increased in all DMD tissues analyzed. Again, these results correspond to the degree of disease phenotype, where mdx:utr and human DMD patients demonstrated the greatest increases in protein levels. Results from both DMD1 and DMD2 tissues were very similar, indicating that Cx43 remodeling occurs in these patients independent of specific pathology, as the cause of death for DMD1 was heart failure and DMD2 was pulmonary embolism.\nCx43 localization is regulated through a variety of mechanisms, including protein trafficking following translation and overall stabilization of intercalated discs. In DMD, destabilization of the DGC includes the loss of anchored actin and desmin proteins. While both are known to play significant roles in maintaining cardiomyocyte morphology and function, recently the role of actin in trafficking of Cx43 has been specifically established. These studies show that disruptions in the interaction of Cx43 with the actin cytoskeleton lead to mislocalization of Cx43, especially in cardiomyopathy 42 . In addition, Cx43 is classically found by western blot in np-Cx43 and p-Cx43 bands, corresponding to non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Cx43, respectively, due to relative amounts of phosphorylated residues affecting protein migration through the gel. Since at least 21 phosphorylation sites are known to exist on Cx43, with many required for protein trafficking, alterations in phosphorylation may also contribute to the lateralization of the protein and subsequent functional implications. Thus, these results merit further study.\nWhile our results show that Cx43 is upregulated in all DMD models and human samples examined, Cx43 is typically downregulated in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. As the DMD mouse and human hearts analyzed do not display cardiac hypertrophy, one of the conditions where this pattern is typically seen 26 , our findings demonstrate that in DMD cardiomyopathy Cx43 is remodeled in a novel manner. These findings represent the first time that Cx43 has been analyzed in the mdx:utr mouse model, form a direct correlation between the severity of DMD disease phenotype with Cx43, and describe a pattern of pathological Cx43 remodeling independent of hypertrophy specific to DMD.\nCx43 peptide mimetics have been used extensively in research related to ischemia/reperfusion, finding that when administered either before or during a period of ischemia, also at low doses, infarct size can be significantly reduced 43 . However, the effect of these peptides directly as anti-arrhythmic drugs has not been previously evaluated, especially in DMD. Our results demonstrate that DMD mice, which are susceptible to Iso-induced arrhythmias, are protected when either Gap26 or Gap19 is administered prior to challenge. As it has been shown that hemichannels can be targeted and inhibited in less than 15 minutes following peptide mimetic administration 44 , our challenge 20 minutes after treatment represents an effective and selective time point. Not only were arrhythmias prevented but RR and QT intervals were restored near WT levels. As a result, the beneficial effects of peptide mimetic treatment extend beyond anti-arrhythmic traits. We examined whether associated sodium channels could be implicated in overall cardiac benefits observed, especially because an increase in Na v 1.5 through pharmacological intervention has been linked to a rescue in cardiac conduction 39 40 . However, western blotting showed that the effects of Cx43 peptides do not extend to Na v 1.5, as protein levels in treated and untreated hearts were not significantly altered. In addition, although the challenge proved lethal for both mdx and mdx:utr mice within a short period of time, a majority of mdx mice that were treated prior to challenge survived the same dose of Iso. However, we also found that while mdx:utr mice did benefit from treatment in terms of ECG measurements, the challenge proved lethal within hours. As mdx:utr mice represent a severe model of DMD, and time points analyzed were following the development of overt pathological features such as cardiac fibrosis, cardiac functional deficits, and various skeletal muscle phenotypes that would be treated separately in patients 19 , we believe that these results show great potential for early intervention.\nWhile our findings focus on the acute system, the use of Cx43 peptide mimetics as a preventative measure throughout a chronic disease could hold additional benefits, especially related to everyday tasks that would normally elicit a beta-adrenergic response. As a result, studies related to long-term administration could prove significant. Together, we show that Cx43 peptide mimetics protect DMD mice from the development of arrhythmias, prevent lethality in mdx mice, and restore ECG intervals to WT measurements. As alternative Cx43 peptide mimetics have been previously shown to have favorable safety profiles in Phase I clinical trials for other indications, there is great potential for our results to have therapeutic implications in the rare disease of DMD.\n"], "ner": [[[62, 65, "DISEASE"], [127, 137, "GENE"], [300, 310, "GENE"], [569, 572, "DISEASE"], [612, 634, "DISEASE"], [650, 672, "DISEASE"], [777, 780, "DISEASE"], [860, 864, "GENE"], [1086, 1090, "GENE"]], [[1270, 1273, "DISEASE"], [1304, 1326, "DISEASE"]], [[2455, 2459, "GENE"], [2655, 2668, "DISEASE"], [2690, 2694, "GENE"], [3056, 3060, "GENE"], [3312, 3315, "DISEASE"], [3326, 3330, "GENE"], [3331, 3365, "RELATION"], [3607, 3610, "DISEASE"], [3712, 3715, "DISEASE"], [3826, 3829, "DISEASE"], [3912, 3915, "DISEASE"], [3921, 3924, "DISEASE"], [3969, 3973, "GENE"], [4071, 4074, "DISEASE"], [4098, 4101, "DISEASE"], [4107, 4125, "DISEASE"]], [[4127, 4131, "GENE"], [4295, 4298, "DISEASE"], [4367, 4373, "GENE"], [4530, 4534, "GENE"], [4628, 4632, "GENE"], [4688, 4692, "GENE"], [4741, 4745, "GENE"], [4789, 4793, "GENE"], [4800, 4804, "GENE"], [4867, 4871, "GENE"], [5045, 5049, "GENE"]], [[5292, 5296, "GENE"], [5300, 5311, "RELATION"], [5319, 5322, "DISEASE"], [5358, 5362, "GENE"], [5376, 5389, "RELATION"], [5393, 5415, "DISEASE"], [5442, 5445, "DISEASE"], [5611, 5614, "DISEASE"], [5615, 5629, "DISEASE"], [5630, 5634, "GENE"], [5712, 5716, "GENE"], [[5770, 5817], [5812, 5834], "RELATION"], [5813, 5816, "DISEASE"], [5840, 5844, "GENE"], [[5872, 5890], [5884, 5900], "RELATION"], [5885, 5889, "GENE"], [5940, 5943, "DISEASE"]], [[5945, 5949, "GENE"], [6303, 6306, "DISEASE"], [6337, 6340, "DISEASE"], [7193, 7197, "GENE"], [7708, 7711, "DISEASE"]], [[8076, 8080, "GENE"], [8382, 8386, "GENE"], [8412, 8415, "DISEASE"], [8550, 8554, "GENE"], [8732, 8756, "RELATION"], [8780, 8783, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [[3326, 3330, 3312, 3315, "dysregulation"]], [], [[5292, 5296, 5319, 5322, "increased expression"], [5358, 5362, 5393, 5415, "decreased expression"], [5840, 5844, 5813, 5816, "modulator increase disease"], [5885, 5889, 5940, 5943, "pathological role"]], [], [[8550, 8554, 8780, 8783, "therapeutic target"]]], "triplets": [[], [], [[3326, 3330, 3312, 3315, 3331, 3365]], [], [[5292, 5296, 5319, 5322, 5300, 5311], [5358, 5362, 5393, 5415, 5376, 5389], [5840, 5844, 5813, 5816, [5770, 5817], [5812, 5834]], [5885, 5889, 5940, 5943, [5872, 5890], [5884, 5900]]], [], [[8550, 8554, 8780, 8783, 8732, 8756]]], "triplets_text": [[], [], [["Cx43", "DMD", "expression is dramatically altered"]], [], [["Cx43", "DMD", "upregulated"], ["Cx43", "dilated cardiomyopathy", "downregulated"], ["Cx43", "DMD", "direct correlation between the severity of disease phenotype"], ["Cx43", "DMD", "pathological remodeling"]], [], [["Cx43", "DMD", "therapeutic implications"]]], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "sentences": ["\nThe identification of secondary factors for the treatment of DMD has become increasingly essential, as decades of research on dystrophin have demonstrated the difficulty in direct therapeutic targeting.

While both genetic and environmental risk factors have been implicated in AAA formation, the precise genetic markers involved and the factors influencing their expression remain an area of ongoing investigation. DNA methylation has been previously used to study gene silencing in other inflammatory disorders and since AAA has an extensive inflammatory component, we sought to examine the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in mononuclear blood cells of AAA cases and matched non-AAA controls. To this end, we collected blood samples and isolated mononuclear cells for DNA and RNA extraction from four all male groups: AAA smokers ( n  = 11), AAA non-smokers ( n  = 9), control smokers ( n  = 10) and control non-smokers ( n  = 11). Methylation data were obtained using the Illumina 450k Human Methylation Bead Chip and analyzed using the R language and multiple Bioconductor packages.

While both genetic and environmental risk factors have been implicated in AAA formation, the precise genetic markers involved and the factors influencing their expression remain an area of ongoing investigation. DNA methylation has been previously used to study gene silencing in other inflammatory disorders and since AAA has an extensive inflammatory component, we sought to examine the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in mononuclear blood cells of AAA cases and matched non-AAA controls. To this end, we collected blood samples and isolated mononuclear cells for DNA and RNA extraction from four all male groups: AAA smokers ( n  = 11), AAA non-smokers ( n  = 9), control smokers ( n  = 10) and control non-smokers ( n  = 11). Methylation data were obtained using the Illumina 450k Human Methylation Bead Chip and analyzed using the R language and multiple Bioconductor packages. Principal component analysis and linear analysis of CpG island subsets identified four regions with significant differences in methylation with respect to AAA: kelch-like family member 35 ( KLHL35 ), calponin 2 ( CNN2 ), serpin peptidase inhibitor clade B (ovalbumin) member 9 ( SERPINB9 ), and adenylate cyclase 10 pseudogene 1 ( ADCY10P1 ).

{"doc_key": "4463699_Discussion", "text": ["\nIn this study, we examined the genome-wide DNA methylation in the PBMC of patients with AAAs. Since cigarette smoking and increasing age have been found to be an important mediator of DNA methylation in tobacco-related cardiovascular disease, it was necessary to take the age and the smoking history of the patients into consideration in the analyses [ 27 ]. Regardless of smoking status, our analysis demonstrated significant differences in DNA methylation at specific CpG islands that map to two genes of interest:  CNN2  and  SERPINB9 . While the precise functions of these genes remain under scrutiny, there is biologic plausibility to implicate these genes in AAA pathogenesis. The first gene is  CNN2 , which is also known as h2-calponin or calponin 2. CNN2 is an actin-binding protein implicated in cytoskeletal organization and vascular development [ 28 ]. Calponin has been found to be upregulated in stretched vascular walls and may be an important regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype [ 29 ]. Additionally, circulating levels of calponin are found in patients with acute aortic dissection and may be a potential biomarker for this aortic pathology [ 30 ]. The second gene is  SERPINB9 , which is also known as PI9.  SERPINB9  is located at 6p25 and belongs to a family of serine protease inhibitors. SERPINB9 is present in the cytoplasm of cytoxic lymphocytes, inhibits the granule proteinase granzyme B and protects cells from granzyme B induced apoptosis [ 31 , 32 , 33 ]. Moreover, SERPINB9 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis of human vascular smooth muscle cells, again a key process in AAA pathogenesis [ 34 ].\nOur investigation began by investigating global DNA methylation in the PBMC of AAA patients ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table S1 ). For comparison, we also analyzed global DNA methylation in the PBMC of vascular surgery patients without evidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table S1 ). We considered it important to use non-PAD patients as controls as others [ 8 ] have shown diffuse hypermethylation across many genomic loci in patients with systemic atherosclerosis. Our initial analysis, using Human Methylation 450k BeadChips [ 26 ], demonstrated decreased methylation of the  CNN2  gene and hypermethylation of the  SERPINB9  gene. Interestingly, none of the differentially methylated CpGIs within these genes were located in the promoter regions. These non-promoter CpGIs, regarded as CpGI shores, still influence gene expression but likely through a different mechanism such as alternative transcription or by maintaining silenced gene expression that was brought about by other epigenetic modifications [ 35 , 36 ]. Again, it is necessary to emphasize that the exact mechanism by which DNA methylation influences gene expression is still unknown. Regardless, we employed alternative methods to better understand the effects of DNA methylation on the genes of interest. First, we used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to examine the effect of methylation on gene expression. To our dismay, we found no difference in  CNN2  or  SERPINB9  mRNA in PBMC when comparing AAA and control patients. As a secondary method to reconcile these results, we subjected aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal human infrarenal aortic tissue to immunohistochemical analysis. Using this technique, we were able to convincingly demonstrate enhanced expression of CNN2 and SERPINB9 in the aneurysmal aorta, as compared to that of non-AAA controls. Of note, we found the greatest positive staining to be limited to the vascular smooth muscle cell rich media of the aneurysmal aorta ( Figure 3 ). The significance of this is unclear but likely highlights the importance of the vascular smooth muscle cell, and its reaction to inflammation, in AAA pathogenesis. Our results, while somewhat discordant, mirror that of others [ 8 , 36 ] who have found that DNA methylation of CpGI shores functions in a complex manner to regulate gene expression in health and disease.\nThe findings of this study are novel but our investigation has several limitations that must be highlighted. The first is the small sample size associated with this study. This will be addressed in future studies as our research efforts continue and patient enrollment increases. Moreover, our future experiments will also include further characterization of the individual epigenetic marks using sequencing of bisulfite modified DNA and studies on histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation. The second limitation worthy of discussion is the possibility that the differential methylation seen in this study is age-related and not AAA-related, albeit we did attempt to adjust the analyses for age and smoking status. In this study, the control patients were on average ~10 years younger than their AAA counterparts ( Table 1 ). Another limitation of this study is that we used all mononuclear cell types for our analysis. Isolating subtypes of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood has been performed by others [ 25 , 37 ] but is beyond the scope of this report. The last limitation applicable to our study pertains to any investigation of DNA methylation. By studying DNA methylation, we are investigating a genetic modification, the exact effect of which on gene expression is unknown making interpretation of differential methylation very difficult [ 38 ].\n"], "ner": [[[89, 92, "DISEASE"], [519, 523, "GENE"], [530, 538, "GENE"], [666, 669, "DISEASE"], [703, 707, "GENE"], [733, 744, "GENE"], [748, 758, "GENE"], [760, 764, "GENE"], [1202, 1210, "GENE"], [1236, 1239, "GENE"], [1242, 1250, "GENE"], [1326, 1334, "GENE"], [1511, 1519, "GENE"], [1618, 1621, "DISEASE"], [1622, 1634, "RELATION"]], [[1722, 1725, "DISEASE"], [1894, 1921, "DISEASE"], [1923, 1926, "DISEASE"], [2008, 2011, "DISEASE"], [2136, 2151, "DISEASE"], [2265, 2269, "GENE"], [2305, 2313, "GENE"], [3087, 3100, "RELATION"], [3105, 3109, "GENE"], [3115, 3123, "GENE"], [3153, 3156, "DISEASE"], [3422, 3426, "GENE"], [3431, 3439, "GENE"], [3492, 3495, "DISEASE"], [3799, 3802, "DISEASE"]], [[4668, 4671, "DISEASE"], [4835, 4838, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[[1511, 1519, 1618, 1621, "pathological role"]], [[3105, 3109, 3153, 3156, "no relation"], [3115, 3123, 3153, 3156, "no relation"]], []], "triplets": [[[1511, 1519, 1618, 1621, 1622, 1634]], [[3105, 3109, 3153, 3156, 3087, 3100], [3115, 3123, 3153, 3156, 3087, 3100]], []], "triplets_text": [[["SERPINB9", "AAA", "pathogenesis"]], [["CNN2", "AAA", "no difference"], ["SERPINB9", "AAA", "no difference"]], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2], "sentences": ["\nIn this study, we examined the genome-wide DNA methylation in the PBMC of patients with AAAs.

Genome-Wide Analysis of DNA Methylation in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of AAA Patients and Non-Aneurysmal Controls\nHuman Methylation 450k BeadChips [ 26 ] were used to detect DNA methylation in AAA ( n  = 20) and control ( n  = 21) samples, and methylation at CpGIs was analyzed.  Table 1  summarizes the samples used, and  Supplementary Table S1  provides more detailed information about each donor. The 41 samples were run in two batches. PC analysis revealed there were significant global differences in methylation between the two batches. There were also significant differences in methylation with respect to age and AAA diagnosis. When OLS linear regression models included smoking, the fit for age was improved, compared to models that did not include smoking.\nBased on the PC analysis, a subset of 16 CpGIs contributed most to the variance of the PCs significant for AAA diagnosis and age ( Table 3  and  Supplementary Table S2 ). The CpGIs selected for the subset also had a similar direction and magnitude in both batches. This subset was analyzed using OLS linear regression models, and four CpGIs were found to be significantly differentially methylated with respect to AAA ( Table 4 ). Each of these CpGIs are located in the body of a different gene. These genes were  ADCY10P1 ,  CNN2 ,  KLHL35 , and  SERPINB9 .

Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR to Measure mRNA Levels of CNN2 and SERPINB9 in PBMC of AAA Patients and Non-Aneurysmal Controls\nTwo of the genes ( CNN2  and  SERPINB9 ) which were significantly differentially methylated in AAA were selected for follow-up studies which included real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining.\nReal-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  in PBMC of AAA ( n  = 26) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 20) samples.  Table 1  summarizes the sample groups, and  Supplementary Table S1  lists more detailed information about each donor. There were no statistically significant differences in gene expression with respect to AAA diagnosis, age, or smoking. However, there was a trend for  CNN2  to have lower expression, and  SERPINB9  to have higher expression in the AAA than control samples ( Figure 2 ).\n2.3. Immunohistological Staining of CNN2 and SERPINB9 in the Aortic Wall of AAA Patients and Non-Aneurysmal Controls\nImmunohistochemical analysis was performed to visualize expression and localization of  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  in the aortic wall of AAA ( n smoking  = 3,  n non-smoking  = 3) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 4) patients.  Table 2  includes information about each tissue sample used, and  Table 5  includes information about the  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  primary antibodies used. Representative images of aortic tissue samples from a control, an AAA smoker, and an AAA non-smoker are shown in  Figure 3 . While imprecise at best, we attempted to compare the results of our immunohistochemical analysis. Subjectively, control aortas showed no specific staining for  CNN2  in any section of the aorta. AAA aortas displayed much more staining for  CNN2  throughout the media and intima. In samples containing a thrombus, the thrombus also contained many stained cells (not shown). There were no noticeable differences in staining between samples from smokers and non-smokers. Although a statistical comparison is not available, control aortas subjectively appeared to show  SERPINB9  staining in the intima and media. There was also light staining in the adventitia of some controls aortas, but it was not consistent. Female aortas contained less  SERPINB9  staining than male aortas (not shown). AAA aortas generally showed darker  SERPINB9  staining. This was especially noticeable near the intima of most samples. There was also an increase in  SERPINB9  staining in areas of the aorta where the morphology was disrupted and where there was a high density of immune cells.\n\n           ijms-16-11259-t005_Table 5 \n           Table 5 \n           Primary antibodies used in immunohistological analyses. \n           \n             \n           Gene Symbol \n                 Gene ID \n                 Protein Symbols \n                 Full Name \n                 Catalog Number \n                 Supplier \n                 Species \n                 IHC Dilution \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n             CNN2 \n \n \n                 1265 \n                 CNN2 \n                 Calponin 2 \n                 TA503688 \n                 OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA \n                 Mouse monoclonal \n                 1:234 \n               \n                 \n               SERPINB9 \n \n \n                 5272 \n                 CAP3, PI9, SERPINB9 \n                 Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B (ovalbumin), member 9 \n                 TA312970 \n                 OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA \n                 Rabbit polyclonal \n                 1:4667 \n               \n                 \n             \n               \n           \n             \n           IHC, immunohistochemistry. \n             \n               \n           \n             \n        \n2.4 Bioinformatic Analysis of Interactions between CNN2 and SERPINB9\nPotential interactions between  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis \u00ae  (IPA) tool are shown in a network ( Figure 4 ).  SERPINB9  and  CNN2  do not directly interact, but they do interact with several of the same proteins and they are involved in similar pathways. Most of the genes in the network are involved in cell signaling, the immune response, and cell death.\nWe investigated changes in DNA methylation in patients with AAA and followed up the findings by conducting gene and protein expression studies.  Figure 1  presents an outline of our study. The AAA patients included in the methylation study had aortic diameters between 3 and 5 cm and none of them had undergone a surgical AAA repair. First, genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were obtained from PBMC of AAA ( n  = 20) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 21) patients. The DNA methylation data were analyzed by principal component (PC) analysis, and then a subset of CpGIs were further analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression models to detect significant differences in methylation. This analysis revealed four genes with significantly different DNA methylation in AAA samples compared with controls. Two genes with the greatest magnitude of differential methylation, calponin 2 ( CNN2 ) and serpin peptidase inhibitor clade B (ovalbumin) member 9 ( SERPINB9 ), were studied further using real-time quantitative RT-PCR to determine their mRNA levels in PBMC of AAA ( n  = 26) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 20) controls. In addition, immunohistological staining of AAA ( n  = 6) and control human infrarenal abdominal aortas ( n  = 4) was used to determine protein expression and localization. All blood samples were obtained from male patients between the ages of 43 and 88 ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table S1 ). Human aortic AAA samples for immunohistological staining were collected from patients undergoing AAA repair operations, and non-aneurysmal infrarenal abdominal aortic wall samples were collected from autopsies ( Table 2 ).\n"], "ner": [[[87, 90, "DISEASE"], [207, 210, "DISEASE"], [636, 639, "DISEASE"]], [[889, 892, "DISEASE"], [1196, 1199, "DISEASE"], [1296, 1304, "GENE"], [1308, 1312, "GENE"], [1316, 1322, "GENE"], [1330, 1338, "GENE"], [1374, 1377, "DISEASE"], [1412, 1420, "GENE"], [1427, 1431, "GENE"], [1467, 1470, "DISEASE"], [1505, 1511, "GENE"], [1518, 1526, "GENE"]], [], [[2057, 2065, "GENE"], [2185, 2193, "GENE"], [2315, 2320, "GENE"], [2442, 2446, "GENE"], [2563, 2567, "GENE"], [2688, 2694, "GENE"], [2822, 2828, "GENE"], [3066, 3070, "GENE"], [3306, 3310, "GENE"], [3431, 3436, "GENE"], [3557, 3563, "GENE"], [3684, 3689, "GENE"], [3809, 3818, "GENE"]], [[4446, 4449, "DISEASE"]], [[4699, 4707, "GENE"], [4839, 4843, "GENE"], [4975, 4981, "GENE"], [5117, 5125, "GENE"], [5368, 5372, "GENE"], [5377, 5385, "GENE"], [5397, 5400, "DISEASE"], [5457, 5461, "GENE"], [5468, 5476, "GENE"], [5533, 5536, "DISEASE"]], [[5718, 5722, "GENE"], [5729, 5737, "GENE"], [5750, 5753, "DISEASE"], [6010, 6013, "DISEASE"], [6074, 6078, "GENE"], [6088, 6104, "RELATION"], [6111, 6119, "GENE"], [6129, 6146, "RELATION"], [6154, 6157, "DISEASE"]], [[6229, 6233, "GENE"], [6238, 6246, "GENE"], [6269, 6272, "DISEASE"], [6398, 6402, "GENE"], [6409, 6417, "GENE"], [6441, 6444, "DISEASE"], [6631, 6635, "GENE"], [6642, 6650, "GENE"], [6743, 6746, "DISEASE"], [6762, 6765, "DISEASE"], [6962, 6966, "GENE"], [6997, 7000, "DISEASE"], [7042, 7046, "GENE"], [7368, 7376, "GENE"], [7542, 7550, "GENE"], [7591, 7594, "DISEASE"], [7627, 7635, "GENE"], [7742, 7750, "GENE"]], [], [[8330, 8334, "GENE"], [8380, 8384, "GENE"], [8403, 8413, "GENE"], [8596, 8604, "GENE"], [8650, 8654, "GENE"], [8656, 8659, "GENE"], [8661, 8669, "GENE"], [8688, 8745, "GENE"]], [[9126, 9130, "GENE"], [9135, 9143, "GENE"], [9176, 9180, "GENE"], [9187, 9195, "GENE"], [9293, 9301, "GENE"], [9308, 9312, "GENE"]], [[9600, 9603, "DISEASE"], [9733, 9736, "DISEASE"], [9862, 9865, "DISEASE"], [9945, 9948, "DISEASE"], [10318, 10321, "DISEASE"], [10421, 10431, "GENE"], [10434, 10438, "GENE"], [10446, 10500, "GENE"], [10503, 10511, "GENE"], [10614, 10617, "DISEASE"], [10713, 10716, "DISEASE"], [10978, 10981, "DISEASE"], [11062, 11065, "DISEASE"]]], "relations": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [[6074, 6078, 6154, 6157, "decreased expression"], [6111, 6119, 6154, 6157, "increased expression"]], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [[6074, 6078, 6154, 6157, 6088, 6104], [6111, 6119, 6154, 6157, 6129, 6146]], [], [], [], [], []], "triplets_text": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [["CNN2", "AAA", "lower expression"], ["SERPINB9", "AAA", "higher expression"]], [], [], [], [], []], "dataset": "BioTriplEx", "_split": ["val"], "_sentence_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], "sentences": ["\n2.1. Genome-Wide Analysis of DNA Methylation in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of AAA Patients and Non-Aneurysmal Controls\nHuman Methylation 450k BeadChips [ 26 ] were used to detect DNA methylation in AAA ( n  = 20) and control ( n  = 21) samples, and methylation at CpGIs was analyzed.  Table 1  summarizes the samples used, and  Supplementary Table S1  provides more detailed information about each donor. The 41 samples were run in two batches. PC analysis revealed there were significant global differences in methylation between the two batches. There were also significant differences in methylation with respect to age and AAA diagnosis. When OLS linear regression models included smoking, the fit for age was improved, compared to models that did not include smoking.\n", "Based on the PC analysis, a subset of 16 CpGIs contributed most to the variance of the PCs significant for AAA diagnosis and age ( Table 3  and  Supplementary Table S2 ). The CpGIs selected for the subset also had a similar direction and magnitude in both batches. This subset was analyzed using OLS linear regression models, and four CpGIs were found to be significantly differentially methylated with respect to AAA ( Table 4 ). Each of these CpGIs are located in the body of a different gene. These genes were  ADCY10P1 ,  CNN2 ,  KLHL35 , and  SERPINB9 . DNA methylation was decreased in AAA samples compared to controls for  ADCY10P1  and  CNN2 .

Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR to Measure mRNA Levels of CNN2 and SERPINB9 in PBMC of AAA Patients and Non-Aneurysmal Controls\nTwo of the genes ( CNN2  and  SERPINB9 ) which were significantly differentially methylated in AAA were selected for follow-up studies which included real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining.\n", "Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  in PBMC of AAA ( n  = 26) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 20) samples.  Table 1  summarizes the sample groups, and  Supplementary Table S1  lists more detailed information about each donor. There were no statistically significant differences in gene expression with respect to AAA diagnosis, age, or smoking. However, there was a trend for  CNN2  to have lower expression, and  SERPINB9  to have higher expression in the AAA than control samples ( Figure 2 ).\n", "2.3. Immunohistological Staining of CNN2 and SERPINB9 in the Aortic Wall of AAA Patients and Non-Aneurysmal Controls\nImmunohistochemical analysis was performed to visualize expression and localization of  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  in the aortic wall of AAA ( n smoking  = 3,  n non-smoking  = 3) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 4) patients.  Table 2  includes information about each tissue sample used, and  Table 5  includes information about the  CNN2  and  SERPINB9  primary antibodies used. Representative images of aortic tissue samples from a control, an AAA smoker, and an AAA non-smoker are shown in  Figure 3 . While imprecise at best, we attempted to compare the results of our immunohistochemical analysis. Subjectively, control aortas showed no specific staining for  CNN2  in any section of the aorta. AAA aortas displayed much more staining for  CNN2  throughout the media and intima. In samples containing a thrombus, the thrombus also contained many stained cells (not shown). There were no noticeable differences in staining between samples from smokers and non-smokers. Although a statistical comparison is not available, control aortas subjectively appeared to show  SERPINB9  staining in the intima and media. There was also light staining in the adventitia of some controls aortas, but it was not consistent. Female aortas contained less  SERPINB9  staining than male aortas (not shown). AAA aortas generally showed darker  SERPINB9  staining. This was especially noticeable near the intima of most samples.

Figure 1  presents an outline of our study. The AAA patients included in the methylation study had aortic diameters between 3 and 5 cm and none of them had undergone a surgical AAA repair. First, genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were obtained from PBMC of AAA ( n  = 20) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 21) patients. The DNA methylation data were analyzed by principal component (PC) analysis, and then a subset of CpGIs were further analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression models to detect significant differences in methylation. This analysis revealed four genes with significantly different DNA methylation in AAA samples compared with controls. Two genes with the greatest magnitude of differential methylation, calponin 2 ( CNN2 ) and serpin peptidase inhibitor clade B (ovalbumin) member 9 ( SERPINB9 ), were studied further using real-time quantitative RT-PCR to determine their mRNA levels in PBMC of AAA ( n  = 26) and non-aneurysmal ( n  = 20) controls. In addition, immunohistological staining of AAA ( n  = 6) and control human infrarenal abdominal aortas ( n  = 4) was used to determine protein expression and localization. All blood samples were obtained from male patients between the ages of 43 and 88 ( Table 1  and  Supplementary Table S1 ). Human aortic AAA samples for immunohistological staining were collected from patients undergoing AAA repair operations, and non-aneurysmal infrarenal abdominal aortic wall samples were collected from autopsies ( Table 2 ).\n"]}

Microarray-Based DNA Methylation Study\nHuman Methylation 450k BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used to study methylation patterns in AAA and control samples using genomic DNA isolated from PBMC, as described above. The nature of the methylation sites assayed by the chips was extensively described recently [ 26 ]. Samples were run in two batches, and hybridizations were performed by HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (Huntsville, AL, USA).  Table 1  summarizes the sample groups used and  Supplementary Table S1  contains information about each donor.\nMethylation data were analyzed using the R language and multiple Bioconductor packages [ 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ]. Data were quantile adjusted. Methylation data from the chips are ratio beta values, which are calculated by the intensity of the methylated probe over the total intensity. Using the wateRmelon package, ratio beta values were quantile adjusted. Then, ratio beta values were converted to  M  values because ratio statistics are between 0 and 1, which does not work well in linear analyses. This conversion was done using the wateRmelon package [ 47 ]. The package transforms the values using this formula:  M  = log [beta/(1 - beta)]. PC analysis was performed for both batches combined to detect batch differences, and separately to detect global differences in methylation due to diagnosis, age, and smoking. By performing the PC analysis tests were performed on the reduced data without testing each CpGI as a separate hypothesis. We therefore did not correct the beadchip data for multiple testing. We also reduced false positives by using two separate data sets to identify CpGIs which were concordant between the two data sets.\nNext, a subset of CpGIs was created. First, PCs significant for diagnosis, age, and smoking were chosen from each batch. Then the CpGIs that contributed most to the variance within those PCs were isolated. Finally, CpGIs that had the same direction and magnitude of change in each batch were selected, resulting in a subset of 16 CpGIs. This subset was analyzed using OLS linear regression models to determine relevance of diagnosis and covariates [ 49 ]. The IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno. ilmn12.hg19 package from Bioconductor was used to annotate genes [ 48 ].\n4.3.

Table 1  summarizes the samples used and  Supplementary Table S1  contains information about the donors. After PCR, baselines and threshold values were set for signals using Sequence Detection System software according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Applied Biosystems) and the threshold cycle numbers ( C t ) were computed for each well. Relative expression levels were calculated using the \u2206 C t  method where the expression of  RPL  was an internal control. Statistical analysis was performed using OLS linear regression models as implemented in the program R [ 46 ]. The results are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot [ 51 ].\n4.4. Immunohistochemical Analysis of Aortic Tissue\nImmunostaining was carried out with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue as previously described [ 52 ]. The slides were incubated with a primary antibody ( Table 5 ) on an automatic immunostainer (Autostainer; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA).

{"doc_key": "4463699_1. Introduction", "text": ["\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a complex disease that develops due to the interaction of environmental risk factors and genetic predisposition [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ]. In addition to an individual's DNA sequence, other mechanisms can control gene expression, and influence the resulting phenotype of health or disease. The process of controlling gene expression through these alternative methods is known as epigenetics and includes RNA associated silencing, histone modifications and DNA methylation [ 5 ]. DNA methylation, the most well studied epigenetic modification, is a process in which a methyl group is added to a region where a cytosine nucleotide is located next to a guanine nucleotide that is linked by a phosphate. A cluster of CpGs is called a CpG island (CpGI) [ 5 , 6 ]. CpGIs are methylated by a group of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases. Classically, insertion of methyl groups at CpGIs was thought to block the binding of transcription factors to promoters and therefore result in repressed gene expression. More recent investigations have demonstrated that DNA methylation in other regions of the genome, including the gene bodies, are likely to influence gene expression, thus necessitating a comprehensive analysis of all DNA methylation sites [ 7 , 8 , 9 ].\nDespite uncertainty in its precise role, there is accumulating evidence implicating DNA methylation in several common chronic human disease states such as cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disorders and atherosclerosis [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ]. Cigarette smoking has proven to be a powerful environmental modifier of DNA methylation [ 15 ] and is a potential mechanism by which tobacco can affect gene expression. The role of smoking in the development of AAA is well known and a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that smoking is also associated with increased AAA growth and rupture risk [ 16 , 17 ]. Moreover, AAA in both man as well as animal models is characterized by an extensive involvement of the immune system with contributions from a variety of immune cell types [ 1 , 18 , 19 , 20 ]. Despite the potential relationship between cigarette smoking, AAA formation, inflammation and DNA methylation, no investigation has examined the role of DNA methylation in AAA. In this current study, we analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of patients with AAA using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which have been used for methylation studies in other inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome [ 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 ].
