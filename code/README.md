# Code for Benchmarking BioTriplex

This repository contains the code and instructions to replicate the baseline results for the BioTriplex dataset, a 
biomedical relation extraction dataset. The baseline models include LLMs and BERT-based models.

The following directories are focused on replicating the following expriments:
- `llama-rec`: Code for replicating LLaMA-based models on BioTriplex.
- `bert`: Code for replicating BERT-based Relation Extraction on BioTriplex.
- `API-models`: Code for replicating API-based LLMs and PubTator on BioTriplex.
- `dygiexpp`: Code for replicating DyGIE++ NER on BioTriplex (To be uploaded).
